## Books

[*Legend of the Hero*](https://www.fangamer.com/products/legend-of-the-hero) – A book of illustrations and overviews of elements found in many Zelda games. Good for inspiration, or to provide players with a level of in-universe “common knowledge” about a subject.

[*The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia*](https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Hyrule-Historia/dp/1616550414) – Contains concept art, histories, insights, and an official timeline of all Zelda games, published as an official resource by Nintendo.

## Fan Fiction

[The Legend of Zelda: The Demon Road](http://demonroad.thewebcomic.com/) – A fan-made webcomic, detailing a new set of Zelda adventures. A great example of a new story told in the Zelda universe, with Zelda characters.

[Zelda, Don’t be Racist](https://archiveofourown.org/works/2379302) – A fanfic about *Ocarina of Time*’s Zelda spending a sojourn among the Gerudo. A fun example of a Hero’s origin story, and a good setup for a “what if?” campaign.

## Music

[OCRemix](http://ocremix.org/) – A site dedicated to remixing the music of games both classic and new, with, of course, [plenty of Zelda remixes](http://ocremix.org/quicksearch/game/?qs_query=the+legend+of+zelda) to use as background music for your game sessions.

## Video Games

[ALttP Randomizer](https://alttpr.com/) – Take the familiar elements of *A Link to the Past*, and shuffle them around. Reveals many interesting uses of the game’s familiar tools and techniques, and generally just fun to watch people play.

## Websites
