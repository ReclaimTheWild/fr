These Basic Attacks are used in specific circumstances, and have additional rules and caveats.

### Charge
**Requires**: Any Melee Weapon  
**Range**: Special  
**Effect**: At the beginning of this attack, you become Off-Balance until the beginning of your next turn. Then, you may move as if Sprinting, though you do not need to empty your hands first. You must move directly towards your target. Once you reach your target, you perform a Strike Basic Attack.  
**Special**: You must have your full Movement available to you to perform this attack - you cannot have Moved beforehand, and cannot be Slowed or Halted. After this attack, you cannot Move again this turn. If the attack cannot be completed for any reason, then it simply fails.

### Defend
**Requires**: None  
**Range**: Self  
**Effect**: You are considered Hard to Hit until the start of your next turn. If you are wielding a Defensive Weapon (such as a Shield), then your Guard Stats all increase by 1 until the start of your next turn as well.  
**Special**: You cannot use this Basic Attack if you are Off-Balance.

### Sneak Attack
**Requires**: Any Weapon  
**Range**: Weapon  
**Damage**: Weapon + either Combat (Melee & Ranged) or Willpower (Arcane weapons)  
**Effect**: If the target is not Hard to Hit, this attack automatically hits. Roll To-Hit target's Evasion; if successful, you deal an additional (Combat or Willpower) damage.  
**Special**: The target must not be aware of you. Following the attack, the target is made aware of your presence, and if still able, may shout a warning to others as a free action.
