## Basic Attacks

Upon equipping a Weapon, any Hero has the option to perform Basic Attacks with it – they do not need to be learned, and there is no Learn Requirement to be able to use a Basic Attack. All you need is to wield a Weapon capable of that attack.

**Basic Attacks do not cost Stamina or Magic to use. However, all Basic Attacks must Roll To-Hit Evasion.** If you fail to beat your foe’s Evasion, the attack misses, and the foe is entirely unharmed and unaffected by the attack. All Basic Attacks can be Critical Hits. These rules apply even if the Basic Attack is made as part of a Spell or Technique.

Remember: **unless otherwise noted, all Attacks are Standard Actions.**  
(This includes Basic Attacks, Maneuvers, Spells, and Techniques.)

## Melee

These attacks can be done by Heroes wielding Melee Weapons, which are the most common type of armament you’ll find in a Hero’s hands.

### Stab
**Requires**: Long Weapon (such as a Spear)  
**Range**: Line 2  
**Damage**: Weapon + Combat  

### Strike
**Requires**: Any Melee Weapon  
**Range**: Melee  
**Damage**: Weapon + Combat  

### Sweep
**Requires**: Sweeping Weapon (such as an Axe, Bat, Greatsword, or Spear)  
**Range**: Sweep 2  
**Damage**: Weapon + Combat

## Ranged

These Basic Attacks are used to harm enemies well out of arm’s reach. Magical Ranged Attacks use Willpower for their damage, while physical attacks still use Combat.

Since these are all Projectile attacks, remember: if any foe is adjacent to you, then *all* foes are Hard to Hit with *any* Projectile attacks, no matter how near or far they are from you.

### Magic Salvo
**Requires**: Arcane Weapon (such as a Rod or Staff)  
**Range**: Projectile 6 (1-handed) // Projectile 8 (2-handed)  
**Damage**: Weapon + Willpower

### Shoot Arrow
**Requires**: Ranged Weapon (such as a Bow or Crossbow)  
**Range**: Projectile 6 (1-handed) // Projectile 8 (2-handed)  
**Damage**: Weapon + Combat  
**Effect**: Consumes 1 Arrow on use; may use other types of Arrows for additional effects.

### Throw Weapon
**Requires**: Any Weapon  
**Range**: Projectile 6 (1-handed) // Projectile 4 (2-handed)  
**Damage**: Weapon + Combat  
**Special**: Once thrown, the weapon lands under or next to the target (GM’s choice).  
**Special**: Natural Weapons can’t be thrown, unless they have the Returning keyword.

## Unarmed

These attacks can be done by Heroes with an empty hand, or who are wielding a Hands-Free Weapon (such as a Fist). Attacking with an empty hand counts as using a Fist weapon with an Attack Power of 0.

### Dross Toss
**Requires**: Empty Hand, or a Hands-Free Weapon  
**Range**: Projectile 6  
**Damage**: Combat

### Painful Touch
**Requires**: Empty Hand, or a Hands-Free Weapon  
**Range**: Melee  
**Damage**: Weapon + Willpower  

### Punch
**Requires**: Empty Hand, or a Hands-Free Weapon  
**Range**: Melee  
**Damage**: Weapon + Combat
