# Combat Initiative

When a fight begins, all combatants (Heroes and foes alike) roll Initiative.

Each combatant’s Initiative is calculated by making an Agility check (Agility + 2d6 + Bonuses). Play proceeds in order from highest Initiative to lowest. In the case of a tie, combatants can roll off to see who goes in what order, or may otherwise decide between themselves.

## Delaying Initiative

Combatants may also deign to delay their turn, allowing them to go later in a round of combat. This is a permanent choice – for the rest of the battle, they will act at that lower Initiative.

If a combatant should delay past 0, then they simply lose their turn entirely for that round, and their new initiative is (highest Initiative in the encounter + 1), starting in the next Round.
