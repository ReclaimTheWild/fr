# Secondary Races

These are races that do not prominently feature in *Breath of the Wild*, but do appear in other *Zelda* games – and that someone might want to play as.

However, because they are not seen as sentient races in all *Zelda* titles, players need to speak to their GM before choosing one of these Races; the GM’s world building or campaign plot may or may not support their inclusion.
