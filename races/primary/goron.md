## Description

Gorons are people of the mountain – literally. Known for their rocky visage, their mountain homes, and their hearty attitudes, Gorons can be solid friends or deadly foes.

Gorons are tall and rotund, with wide potbellies and large, chestnut-shaped heads, compared to their relatively thin arms and legs. Their skin is earthen, rough to the touch like hewn stone. Gorons do not have hair, per se, but they develop colorful outcroppings of stone on their chin, brow, back, and scalp as they enter adulthood, which then turn white with age. Their eyes are beady, like small polished stones, without irises or other distinguishing features.

Gorons live in large networks of caves, and prefer climates that most would find 'warm' to 'impossibly scorching'. They hew their caves into the side of single mountain - or better yet, an active volcano. Settlement sites are chosen based on the quality of the local rock, as well as what amenities are nearby - like hot springs, lava floes, or even active volcanoes. A typical Goron home might appear primitive and spartan to visitors, with simple decorations of tribal-patterned vases or rough-stitched tapestries, a fire pit, and perhaps some slabs of stone to serve as table, chair, and bed. 

Thanks to their unique physical composition, Gorons can eat rocks and metals. They have a rich culinary culture, and the few Goron foods that are palatable to other species, such as the famed Goron Spice, are considered rare and valuable delicacies.

## Playing a Goron

Gorons can be obstinate and difficult to move to action, but once inspired they will crash upon whatever obstacles are in their way with hearty enthusiasm. In this way, as in all ways, they are like a stone - hard to move, but once moved, even harder to stop.

However, that does not mean Gorons are dour or uncaring. Rather, Gorons have a reputation for a kind of steadfast innocence and obliviousness: when something bad happens, many Gorons simply shrug their shoulders, and continue on as best as they can. Goron Heroes may change their course at bad news, but even they will simply ready themselves to take on a new challenge without belaboring the point. Because of this, few beings rebound from emotional or physical turmoil more quickly than a Goron.

Of course, Gorons famously love eating a good rock – they’ll speak rhapsodically about its flavor, or curiously sample the taste of new rocks as they come across them. To a Goron, no rock is “just a rock”, and each stone tells a story with its taste and texture.

Gorons value sheer physical strength and endurance. Gorons make friends by inviting one another to attempt contests of might and constitution. Simply making a good effort may be enough to get into a Goron's good graces, but succeeding at the test is a sure way to gain friendship. Gorons are quick to recognize those who succeed or surpass them, and are rarely jealous – instead, they welcome the victor like a new brother.

Gorons Heroes typically favor melee physical combat, preferring to enter the fray and bash foes like an unstoppable avalanche. Goron legends speak highly of hammers, as well as simply punching foes directly – so many Goron Heroes use hammers, mauls, and Fist weapons, in the spirit of their ancestors.

## Goron Biology

Gorons are unique among the species of Hyrule, as they appear to all be males.  
Unlike the Gerudo and their husband-hunting ways, however, they are rarely, if ever, seen searching for mates – in their tribes or outside of them. 

Some believe that Gorons do actually have the typical two sexes, but with very little discernable distinction between them – or at least, distinctions only Gorons can identify.

Others say that Gorons are not so much ‘born’ as they are hewn from the rock, carved like a statue or grown like a geode, and then given life by magic.

A third theory states that Gorons are like trees or flowers, having the capacity to work as either gender as the situation demands. Their identification as ‘bro’ is merely a quirk of language or culture – or a reflection on those observing them.

Gorons are also unique for their diet, preferring rocks over other nutrients. They appear to prefer simple stone to all else, followed by metals as a mid-quality food, and ending with gems as a sour, unappetizing foodstuff.

Despite their unique culinary capability, Gorons are happy to partake in the foods that other races eat. In particular, Gorons seem to enjoy spicy foods, and their famed Goron Spice (a kind of sweet, spicy curry powder) is famed far and wide.

Finally, once every few generations, a Goron is born who grows monumentally huge, rivaling the size of some mountains. Despite their immense size, these “Bigorons” remain a friendly part of their community, if prone to sleeping for days at a time.
