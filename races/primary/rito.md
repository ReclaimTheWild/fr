## Description

Perched on tall spires and nested in cold climes, the Rito revel in their skill and grace. Capable of flight as adults, they travel long distances to trade, learn, or seek adventure.

Rito are lanky humanoid birds, with wings for arms and beaks for mouths. Their featherscan be any one color or combination of colors. The tips of their wings are typically white, and those feathers are dexterous and strong enough to serve as broad fingers. Their legs are those of a bird: two sharp talons face forward; one faces backwards. Their eyes are similar to those of Hylians, sharing the same hues and general shape.

Rito towns are typically situated in remote, mountainous places, surrounded by valleys – the perfect lookout to see all land-dwelling visitors from miles off.

Despite their remote, inaccessible locations, Rito towns still maintain contact with the outside world – their citizens have no trouble traveling hither and yon, and the occasional adventurous soul still manages to climb many a Rito town's crags in order to visit.

## Playing a Rito

Rito respect skill above all else. It matters little what the skill actually is, so long as one strives for excellence. Some Rito are self-important, caught up in their own peerless prowess; many others can still be respectful, helping others to rise to a challenge.

When interacting with others, Rito tend to seek the high ground, both literally (preferring to perch above someone's sightline, if possible) and metaphorically. When someone concedes a point to a Rito in an argument, they will gladly seize upon that and try to press further.

Because of this, Rito have a reputation among other races for being haughty or conceited. If a Rito is the best at something, or knows something that another wishes to know, they rarely shy away from making that fact known. 

However, the reverse is also true - if someone impresses them with a skill that exceeds their own, most Rito won't hide their appreciation (however they choose to express it). Because of this, Rito also have a reputation as excellent teachers and storytellers.

Rito take pride in archery, finding it most useful when they take to the air, though no technique is beneath the effort it takes to master it. Since their main asset in battle is flight, Rito warriors and wizards will often look to ways to utilize it to the utmost, staying out of range of foes while in the air – or swooping in to attack foes at the rear.

## Rito and Flight

The Rito way of life incorporates their natural prowess at flight in ways both subtle and obvious.

Rito architecture favors wide, open spaces, resembling a gazebo more than anything else. Their homes have few walls or doors, and lots of openings into the great outdoors. This allows them to quickly exit a room and take flight. 

Rito tend to fare poorly when in closed, cramped environs, like caves or tight corridors. While some races might call this claustrophobia, the Rito would call it a rational fear - Rito see their power of flight as their greatest strength over others, and when it is nullified, they get justifiably concerned.

If given the chance, Rito will fully use whatever vertical space is available to them, preferring to be up high whenever possible. Rito might perch on top of a bookcase or the back of a chair when having a conversation, or they might prefer to sit on the roof of a house instead of on the porch. For a Rito, claiming the high ground is a simple, unconscious instinct.
