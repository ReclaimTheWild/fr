## Description

Subrosians are a species of small, cloaked figures, originally from the hidden land of Subrosia, deep beneath Holodrum. Subrosia is a world very different from our own, lit by volcanoes and magma floes, covered in desolate scrubland.

Since the fall of Calamity Ganon, Subrosians have contacted the surface world, and are now reaching out and beginning to travel. Most surface-dwellers see them just as adorable tourists, and pay them little heed.

Subrosians have never shown their bare selves to anyone not of their race, preferring to hide their forms under large, concealing cloaks and hoods. Their faces appear as a pitch-black void – leading some to suspect they are spirits of darkness or the earth, rather than flesh and blood creatures.

Subrosians are short – no taller than a child Hylian. They do not seem to have ever been children, at least as far as any outside observers have seen of their communities. Their large eyes glow with a pale light, and hold no pupils or irises.

## Playing a Subrosian

In general, Subrosians are happy-go-lucky and naive, sometimes to a fault. Many display a childlike innocence, asking straightforward questions about things that most would consider obvious.

Subrosians also deeply enjoy the act of trading things. Their eagerness to trade, combined with their often-guileless demeanor, can lead to some merchants being taken so aback that the Subrosian walks away with a better deal than anyone would expect.

Subrosian Heroes don’t tend towards any one particular fighting style, having no real gift for combat or magic. Rather, they’ll often try to talk or listen their way out of a problem, using Maneuvers.

**Characteristics**: Avid, Curious, Direct, Eager, Guileless, Naïve

**Subrosian Names** tend to be descriptors, based on the Subrosian’s job or hobbies, rather than ‘actual’ names. If a Subrosian’s job or hobbies change, so too might their chosen name.

**Names**: Blacksmith, Dancer, Sign-Loving Subrosian, Smelter, Strange Brother, Wanderer

## Stranger on the Surface

For Subrosians, *everything* about the surface world is new and exciting. If they’re new to the surface world, a Subrosian might find trees, flowers, people, and even the blue sky itself to be fascinating and wondrous.

This child-like curiosity doesn’t mean Subrosians are unintelligent – once taught a fact, they will retain it as readily as anyone, and proudly repeat it to any who ask. If a Subrosian has been above-ground for a while, they might enjoy explaining things to people, showing off how much they know and care about ‘weird’ surface things.

Subrosians enjoy leisure activities, and their homeland of Subrosia is renowned for its hotsprings and dancehalls. A Subrosian is likely to leap at the chance to try a new game, partake in a new leisure activity, or just given the chance to relax in a unique or novel way.
