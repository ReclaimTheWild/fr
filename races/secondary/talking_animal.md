## Description

Talking Animals are not one species, but a collection of them: animals roughly the same size as a person, and just as intelligent and skilled. Native to Labrynna, and said to have founded their own village on the mythical island of Koholint, they can nonetheless be found in other lands on rare occasion.

Talking Animals may be of any number of species: alligators, bears, kangaroos, lions, rabbits, and on and on. Despite the varied menagerie they form, Talking Animals share some similarities: a love for listening to music, a calm and peaceful demeanor when their needs are satisfied, and eyes that display the intelligence and emotions that separate Talking Animals from their lesser counterparts.

Most Talking Animals are bipedal, even if the ‘normal’ animal they are akin to would be quadrupedal. No matter the number of legs, however, they can wield weapons and wear armor just as well as any Hylian, though it may occasionally chafe against their fur.

## Playing a Talking Animal

Talking Animal Heroes are considered naive by some, with simple goals and simple plans to achieve them. Although they are civilized enough to live and work in towns built by other races, their outlook on life will always be grounded in the basic natural instincts that all animals share. Some Talking Animals may lean into those instincts, while others strive to rise above them.

Other races may have varying outlooks on Talking Animals, based on the Animal’s species – generally, depending on whether or not that species is seen as ‘cute’ or ‘dangerous’. A rabbit Talking Animal might be talked down to, seen as cute and childish (even if they’re a fearsome warrior); a bear might be seen as a deadly ruffian (even if they’re a nice and gentle person).

Talking Animals sometimes struggle with having to make a ‘second first impression’ based on who, rather than what, they are. If given the chance (such as communicating by mail) they may choose to present themselves as Hylian, to avoid this issue. A few Talking Animals will even obscure their face and body, such as with heavy, concealing armor, to hide their nature while talking face-to-face with strangers.

Talking Animal Heroes are difficult to pin down as a whole, and individuals of different species are likely to take different paths to heroism. As a very general rule, however, Talking Animals make for excellent warriors, particularly when resources are scarce: naturally-sharp claws and hides tough as armor are primary examples of this, but the ability to fly or swim quickly also enables them to act as skirmishers, scouting ahead and harrying foes. However, as with all broad rules of thumb, there are exceptions aplenty.

**Characteristics**: Aware, Civilized, Dual-Natured, Instinctual, Natural, Peaceful

**Talking Animal Names** are varied as their species, but fall into a few patterns:
- Ordinary names 
- Animal puns & onomatopoeia
- Simple pet-like names

The origins of a Talking Animal name might be from any real-world language, giving them a wide variety of possible names.

**Female Names**: Christine, Edelweiss, Louise, Piyoko

**Male Names**: Dmitri, Kiki, Masaru, Moosh, Ricky, Schule

All Talking Animal effect calculations are done using your base Trait scores, unmodified by bonuses from Dishes, Elixirs, Enchantments, or other effects.

## Example Talking Animals

**Bears** are large, muscular brutes, who prefer sleeping and eating to fighting. Bears often enjoy listening to music and lazing the day away in a peaceful meadow. When their friends are threatened, they become deadly combatants. Bears have the Armed, Mount, and Scent-Sense attributes.

**Bees** are community-minded creatures, putting the good of the group above their own. Talking Animal Bees are the size of a Hylian child, but industrious as the most experienced tradesperson. Their famous honey is considered the perfect toast-topper. Bees have the Cooperative, Mover (Flying), and Producer (Food) attributes.

**Crocodiles** are large, scaly, and often quite sedate. They usually seem content to let the world wash over them – until they decide to strike decisively. Crocodiles have the Armed, Armored, and Mover (Swimming) attributes.

**Moles**, sometimes called Mogma, are renowned for their ability to dig tunnels and hollow out caverns. They dig for Rupees, ore, and treasure, leading some to think them greedy. Moles have the Blind-Sense, Burrower, and Producer (Metal) attributes.

**Rabbits** are known for leaping into trouble. Though many see Rabbits as cowards who flee at the first sign of trouble, they often have a deep well of inner courage and humility. Rabbits have the Leaper, Ruminant, and Scent-Sense attributes.

**Wolves** are team players, working with the group to accomplish a task. They are also skilled hunters, living in the wilderness for weeks at a time, hunting prey for food and materials. Wolves have the Armed, Cooperative, and Scent-Sense attributes.

You may also come up with new kinds of Talking Animals, or use the Talking Animal race to create your own custom Race. Some players have used the Talking Animal Race to play as robots, Lynels, or other unique creations! Speak with your GM to find a solution that works for you.
