# Awareness Range

By default, Monsters have the same sight that Heroes do – they can only see things that are illuminated and in front of them.

In addition to this, Monsters may have:
- Darkvision. The creature can see just as well in the dark as they can in the light.
- Eagle-Eyed. The Monster’s awareness range is limited only by the horizon.
- Magic Sense. The foe can feel when magic is being cast, when enchanted (or invisible) things are nearby, or when a Song is being performed.
- Omnidirectional. The Monster’s vision is not merely forward-facing – they are aware in all directions at all times, making it much harder to sneak up on them.
- Scent Sense. The creature can ‘see’ using scent, rather than their eyes.
- Truthsight. The creature has the Lens of Truth spell active at all times.
- X-Ray. The Monster can see through wood or stone walls up to a square thick.
