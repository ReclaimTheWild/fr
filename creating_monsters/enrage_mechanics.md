# Enrage Mechanics

Some foes may have an Enrage mechanic – under certain circumstances, they become even more dangerous.

While Enraged, you might increase any number of a foe’s Traits by up to +2, or just a few Traits by up to +4. You might increase its Movement, grant it new Elemental or Status Resistances or Immunities, change its Defense category, or grant it access to new Spells or Techniques.

During some Enrage mechanics, the Monster might *lose* Traits – for instance, they might be blinded with rage, losing Perception. 

Whatever Traits or stats are changed, it’s important to make it clear to Heroes that the Monster’s become Enraged. Be sure to show that the foe has gotten meaner or stronger!

All Enrage mechanics must have a trigger, and that trigger typically requires external input – a Hero’s actions, or environmental factors, have to be the cause of the monster’s increased power. Some Enrage mechanics may also have means to unenrage the monster, at least for a time; this is more common with Bosses, where they may cycle through calm and Enraged states multiple times throughout a fight.

Giving enemies Enrage mechanics is a fun way to keep players engaged and on their toes, and make sure a battle doesn’t become rote or predictable. It’s encouraged to give difficult foes this extra wrinkle in their battle plans!
