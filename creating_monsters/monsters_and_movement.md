## How Much Movement?

Monsters may have up to 10 Movement. However, we recommend you *not* grant that much Movement to every Monster!

Some Monsters will have 0 Movement –stationary foes and traps, like Beamos, Deku Babas, and Derelict Guardians.

Particularly slow foes will have 1-3 Movement. This allows Heroes to easily outpace them, and even pelt them with longranged attacks while staying out of melee range with the Monster.

A typical Monster will have about 4-6 Movement. That’s enough to keep up with a Hero in a hectic fight, but not quite enough to outrun them over open ground. This also allows Heroes to cleverly place obstacles to keep the foe out of melee range, at least for a time. (Remember that Heroes, by default, have 6 Movement.)

Particularly quick-footed foes will have 7 or more Movement. This allows them to keep up with any Hero (or even most Mounts!), even if their path has a few obstructions.

## Other Considerations

Monsters start as only Natural Walkers: if they fall into the water, they will drown. However, you may designate a Monster as able to Swim, Glide, or Fly. Unless you also designate the Monster as a Natural at a given mode of movement, though, they will travel only half as fast in these modes of movement as they would by Walking.

Monsters can also be Mounts. This allows another creature, of the Monster’s size or smaller, to utilize it as a Mount. 

Finally, Monsters may be immune to a given type of Terrain, such as “slick terrain” or “lava”. This works just like making them immune to a Status Effect. Monsters can’t be Resistant to Terrain – it’s all or nothing.
