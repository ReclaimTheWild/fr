Monsters typically do not wear pieces of Armor like Heroes do. Instead, Monsters are assigned a Defense score, based on how tough they should be. 

Select one of the levels of armor from the chart above: Unarmored, Civilian, Light, Medium, Heavy, Extreme, or Impervious. The Monster gains a modifier to their Evasion based on their armor level, and Defense based on their Rank, per the chart above.

You can then further tweak their defenses: for every point of Defense added, increase their Evasion Penalty (or vice-versa).

(As a note on balance: Extreme armor will likely require their foes to use attacks that deal (2 x Trait) damage to harm them, while Impervious foes require (3 x Trait) attacks.)

When a (non-Unarmored!) Monster puts on additional Armor, that Armor provides only half its usual Defense (rounding down). The Armor’s full Evasion penalty still applies.

## Partial Armor

Some monsters’ armor might only cover *most* of their body. If struck in an unarmored spot, they only apply half Defense to the damage!

For each unarmored spot, select one square that is adjacent to the foe, relative to them: Melee attacks from that square, or Ranged attacks that pass directly through that square, hit the Monster’s unarmored spot. Unarmored spots are typically Hard to Hit, and/or must be revealed in some way.

When the Monster ends their turn, they decide their facing, and thus, the position of their unarmored spots. This choice lasts until their next turn, unless the creature is moved.

## Enchantments

Monsters may have Enchantments on their weapons or armor (whether or not they are Natural). Monsters may have up to 3 Armor Enchantments applied to them in total, as if they were wearing Armor. 

Each Enchantment counts as another item, meaning that the Monster drops one more Material than otherwise – typically, a Gem of the type used to cast the Enchantment, or an additional Monster Part.

Enchantments may only be of a Rank up to the Monster’s Rank.

As a rough guideline, we recommend Monsters only have (Monster’s Rank) many Enchantments applied to them, at most.
