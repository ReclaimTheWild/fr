# Rank and Traits

When designing a monster, the first question is: what Rank is this foe? A Monster’s Rank determines a lot about a foe, such as how high its Traits may be, per the chart at right.

Aside from this limit, **you may assign a foe’s Traits as you like – unlike Heroes, you aren’t buying Traits with Tokens.**  
Don’t be afraid to grant a foe decent scores in a Trait that seem ‘useless’!

| Monster Rank  | Trait Max   |
|---------------|-------------|
| Rank 0        | 3           |
| Rank 1        | 5           |
| Rank 2        | 6           |
| Rank 3        | 8           |
| Rank 4        | 10          |
| Rank 5        | 15          |
{: .rtw-table .fixed-columns .centered-bold .half-width }

As a recommendation, we suggest that:
- Only a few (0-3) Traits be at their max.
- About half of the foe’s Traits be 1-2 points below their potential maximum.
- Most of the rest of the foe’s Traits be well below their maximum (3+ points).

These recommendations aim to make a foe that has a few strengths, as well as a few weaknesses, in their Trait distribution – making them more fun to fight overall.

(NOTE: If a Monster has a Hearts Trait of 0, they have 1 HP, not 0.)
