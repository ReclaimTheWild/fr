# Status Protection

Monsters may be resistant to certain Weather, Status Effects, or Maneuvers, or even be immune to them!

Monsters may be Resistant to a specific Status Effect or Maneuver. Resistances to Status Effects and Maneuvers have Ranks, and provide a bonus of (Rank) to the Monster’s Guard Stats to resist the effect.

Monsters may also be Immune to a Status Effect or Maneuver. A Monster that is Immune to a Status Effect or Maneuver simply cannot be affected by it.

If a combatant attempts to use a Status Effect or Maneuver on a Monster that has protection against it, they should be informed of that fact after resolving the attempt – they should only need to make the mistake once to learn their folly.
