Heroes will battle many kinds of foes, but more than anything, a Monster's intelligence defines how they fight. When creating a Monster, decide whether they are of Instinctive, Limited, or Rational Intelligence.

## Instinctive

Instinctive creatures have no true intelligence to speak of. They act solely based on their instinct, reacting to the world around them without any forethought or insight. Instinctive foes will always attempt the same strategies, regardless of how well or poorly they might turn out. Ravenous plants and wild animals, mechanical automata, and brainless undead foes, are all Instinctive.

Instinctive creatures typically do not use Reactions (including Parry and Deflect). They are often unable to understand language or communicate in meaningful ways. They cannot change their behaviors when their opponents use the Predict Maneuver. An Instinctive creature's attack pattern is determined before combat, and can only be altered in limited ways once a fight begins.

## Limited

Limited intelligence creatures have some brainpower, but are constrained in its use. They may be under a mind-controlling spell, be a well-trained pet, a summoned spirit bound by magic, or simply be loyal soldiers under strict orders. Their behavior may change when ordered, or based on certain stimuli, but a Limited creature rarely, if ever, sacrifices an immediate gain for a later victory – making them vulnerable to clever strategies and tactics.

Creatures of Limited intelligence may use Reactions in combat, but will typically use them at the first available opportunity, which may leave them vulnerable to attacks later in the round. They rarely seek out new items (and only if doing so provides an obvious, self-evident advantage), and they may need training from a Rational creature to use them.

Limited creatures will change strategy if their master commands it, or if circumstances strongly suggest it’s a good idea. If a mind-controlled creature's master is defeated, or its method of control is disabled, then the Limited creature reverts to either Instinctive or Rational intelligence, as per its nature.

## Rational

Rational creatures have their own will, and can devise their own plans to further their goals. They may decide to sacrifice short-term profit for long-term gain, or be convinced to change their ways - in some cases, a few wise words may change a Rational foe into a friend. Heroes, evil wizards, great spirits, and simple townspeople are all considered Rational, however logical or crazed they may be.

Rational creatures may use Reactions in combat freely, and may choose to not use them for strategic or personal reasons. A Rational creature may call out strategies to its compatriots, make feints, and generally fight to the fullest of their strategic acumen. Rational foes are the most likely to have additional equipment, such as Tools and Elixirs, to use in battle. They are also likely to have prepared for the fight, wearing Armor that helps in the local terrain, or having eaten a Dish to grant themselves a boon.
