# Attacks & Feats

Monsters don’t just use Basic Attacks to accomplish their goals – they can use Feats, Spells, and Techniques, just like Heroes.

While Monsters do not use Tokens to determine what they can use, there are some guidelines for what creatures should have.

Most Normal monsters should have no more than three Spells or Techniques. Heavy and Miniboss Monsters might have one more; true Boss Monsters might have up to half a dozen Spells or Techniques to bring to bear.

Generally, Monsters should have Feats, Spells, or Techniques that befit their Rank.
- All Monsters can have Feats, Spells, or Techniques that cost 3 Tokens.
- Feats, Spells, and Techniques that cost 6 Tokens should generally be kept to foes of Rank 2 or more.
- Feats, Spells, and Techniques that cost 9 Tokens should generally be kept to foes of Rank 4 or more.
