# Forge Quality

By default, all Forges are equal in *Reclaim the Wild* – you can craft as well at one as at any other. In Master Mode, however, you can only craft high-quality items at high-quality Forges.

When you craft Weapons, Armor, or Tools at a Forge, their Rank cannot exceed the Rank of the Forge itself. In addition, when you Transmute Materials, the resultant Materials’ Rank can’t exceed the Rank of the Forge itself. For instance, you can craft a Rank 3 sword at a Rank 3 Forge, but you can’t craft a Rank 4 sword at that same Rank 3 Forge.

In general, the more impressive the Forge, the higher its Rank. For instance, a Forge in a small town might only be Rank 1 or 2, a Forge in a large city might be Rank 3 or 4, while a legendary Forge found in a hidden grotto might be Rank 5.

Note that this rule does *not* apply to Dishes or Elixirs, or any other kinds of crafting that do not use a Forge.

If you are also using the *Rebuild the Wild* supplement, you may build or upgrade Forges to enable you to craft better items – if the Forge’s proprietor allows.
