# Size Matters

Some characters, depending on their Race, might be smaller or larger than most. For instance, a Fairy Hero might be the size of another Hero’s hand, while a Talking Animal Hero based on a bear or elephant might be as big as two other Heroes put together.

As part of Master Mode, these differences in size are made more distinct and impactful.

To wit:
- For every size category below Medium, a creature gains 1 Evasion, and your weapons’ Attack Power decreases by 2.
- For every size category above Medium, a creature loses 1 Evasion, and your weapons’ Attack Power increases by 2.
- In addition, if you are Diminutive or Tiny, each point in your Hearts score grants only 3 HP. If you are Huge or Gigantic, each point in your Hearts score grants 5 HP. If you are Colossal, each point in your Hearts score grants 6 HP.

Note that these rules, if used, apply equally to both Heroes and monsters alike.

Regardless of their size, all creatures can still use weapons and armor equally – no matter their size, Heroes and monsters should not have more or less trouble finding equipment.
