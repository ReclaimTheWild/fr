# Wallets and Quivers

Traditionally, Zelda games have limited the amount of rupees and arrows Link can carry at one time. However, ignoring the weight of money and ammunition is increasingly standard in both video games and in tabletop RPGs. By default, *Reclaim the Wild* has few limits on how many Rupees, arrows, or bombs can be carried at once – but for those who want that element and extra challenge of inventory management, Master Mode provides.

First, add a Wallet to the Hero’s Pack. Wallets act like any other Inventory type, except they can only carry a single type of thing: Rupees. The Wallet begins with only a single slot, and can be upgraded as any other Inventory type could be. Each slot in the Wallet can carry 100 Rupees – meaning a Hero with the maximum size of Wallet can carry up to 3,000 Rupees on their person. (It is suggested that Heroes who wish to deal with large amounts of money in this scenario seek out, or establish, a Bank or other safe place to store any money they cannot carry.)

Second, the Ammunition inventory is slightly altered: each slot in the Ammunition inventory can now only carry 20 of a given type of ammunition. If a Hero has 40 Arrows, they would take up 2 slots – and if they have 41 Arrows, they would take up 3 slots.

Slots in a Hero’s overflow Inventory also follow these rules: a single slot in the overflow Inventory can carry 100 Rupees, or 20 units of an Ammunition type.
