# More Maneuvers

Some games may want to have more luckbased battles, where characters will gain and lose the upper hand more frequently, owing to the vagaries of the tide of battle.

Under this rule, Roll To-Hit Evasion for *all* attacks, whether or not they would normally hit automatically. Whenever a combatant rolls *doubles* on a To-Hit Roll – be it a Basic Attack, or a Spell or Technique’s special effect – they may then, as a Free Action, attempt a Combat or Social Maneuver of their choice against the target of their attack. This Maneuver attempt occurs even if the To-Hit Roll misses, or the target uses a Reaction to blunt the attack.

The target of the attack must be within the Maneuver’s range in order for the attacker to choose to use it, and the attacker must otherwise be able to attempt the Maneuver.
