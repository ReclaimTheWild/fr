# Alternate Companion Growth

By default, Companions gain Tokens when Heroes spend theirs. With this Master Mode rule, Companions will gain Tokens when their associated Hero does. This can provide an easier means of keeping track of Tokens, such as when using automated spreadsheets, and it can allow Companions to advance even if their Hero is saving Tokens for a larger purchase. As with the default rules, remember to keep track of fractional Tokens - these canâ€™t be spent, but they can become a full Token with enough time.
