# Injury

By default, Heroes in *Reclaim the Wild* do not need to worry about long-lasting injury. So long as their HP remains above 0, Heroes are just as capable in their hundredth fight as in their first.

In Master Mode, Heroes (and all characters) need to worry about Injuries. Heroes sustain an Injury whenever any of the following occurs:
- They reach 0 Hit Points.
- They take damage equal to or greater than 50% of their maximum Hit Points from a single attack.
- They enter Peril. 

(Going into Peril can only inflict an Injury once per combat encounter – entering and exiting Peril multiple times in a single battle does not incur multiple Injuries.)

The above ways to gain an Injury may all stack, even within a single attack. For instance, if a foolhardy Hero takes enough damage to go from full health to none in a single blow, they will receive 3 Injuries: one for taking more than half their maximum Hit Points in damage from a single attack, one for entering Peril for the first time in the battle, and another for reaching 0 Hit Points.

When a Hero suffers an Injury, they suffer a -1 penalty to all Trait checks in a given Aspect of the Triforce (Power, Wisdom, or Courage). The afflicted Aspect should be chosen randomly with a d6: 1-2 = Power, 3-4 = Wisdom, 5-6 = Courage. However, if the GM and player agree on the Aspect that should be damaged (based on the attack and its description), then they may jointly choose the injured Aspect.

There is no limit to the number of Injuries a Hero can have on them at a given time.

During an Extended Rest, if a Hero is fed enough to stave off Hunger (or if the Hunger rules, above, are not being used in your game), they may remove one Injury of their choice. Then, a Hero may attempt to have one additional Injury of their choice removed from them by *one* of the methods below.
- Any *one* person can perform a Nature check on the injured Hero (including the Hero themselves).
- OR, the Hero in question can perform a Fortitude check.

Regardless of the Trait Check attempted, the DC is equal to (10 + (Number of Injuries the Hero has in total)).

In addition, a Small Fairy may be used to remove a single Injury from a Hero. This does not have any check – the Small Fairy succeeds automatically. This can be done even if the Hero has already attempted to heal an Injury via one of the above methods.
