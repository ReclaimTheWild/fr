# Feats, Spells, and Techniques

All Heroes can use Basic Attacks and Maneuvers in a fight, and their Traits to navigate social and environmental hazards. However, Heroes can further personalize their fighting style, magical repertoire, and their capabilities, by learning Feats, Spells, and Techniques.

**Feats** represent knowledge, training, or natural aptitude that a Hero uses under certain circumstances. Feats aren’t so much “things you do” as “things you are or know”.

**Spells** are specific magical incantations or actions that a Hero has learned to use. Not all spells are focused on causing destruction in combat; some Spells manipulate the natural world in useful ways.

**Techniques** are specific attacks or forms of combat that a Hero has learned to use. Techniques tend to be entirely focused on combat, using weapons in clever ways that quickly harm or disable a foe.

## Notes

**All Trait Requirements for Feats use your base Trait**, ignoring any boosts from Dishes, Elixirs, Enchantments, or other circumstances.

**You may only take a particular Feat once**, unless a Feat says otherwise.

**Spells and Techniques hit automatically**, unless other circumstances (such as Status Effects) state otherwise. Spells and Techniques cannot be Critical Hits, even if circumstances make it possible for them to miss. If a Spell or Technique won’t hit automatically (due to whatever circumstances), roll To-Hit vs. Evasion; if you miss, the Spell or Technique has no effect.

**When a Spell or Technique says to make a Basic Attack**, you must still roll To-Hit with that Basic Attack. This means that these Basic Attacks may miss, hit, or even be Critical Hits.
