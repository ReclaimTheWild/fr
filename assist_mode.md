# Assist Mode

Assist Mode is a collection of optional rules for Reclaim the Wild. These rules are intended to make the game less complex or difficult.

Be warned that using these rules may result in a less engaging experience, as they essentially *remove* systems, like crafting, resource gathering, or weapon durability. While we believe these systems are integral to the experience of *Reclaim the Wild*, we recognize that some players or GMs may want or need to remove them. 

These rules are not intended for every game – rather, they’re intended to be used only after the GM and the players have discussed the additional rules, and their ramifications. **By default, games run in Reclaim the Wild do NOT use Assist Mode rules.**

Assist Mode rules can be applied to a game as a whole, or the GM may choose to use some rules, and discard others. GMs should be very clear with their players about which rules are or are not in use!
