# Easier Ingredients

There’s a wide variety of Critters and Food Ingredients in *Reclaim the Wild*, each with different special effects. This can make it difficult for GMs to decide exactly which kind of Critter their players find, and can make it difficult for players to record all of the edible goodies they find.

Under this rule, the effects of Critters and Food Ingredients are greatly simplified. Rather than having specific species with specific effects, all Critters and Food Ingredients simply have a Rank, much like other Materials. When used to craft Dishes or Elixirs, the crafting Hero simply selects the resultant item’s effect from [this list]({{ "/equipment_crafting/foods_elixirs#food--elixir-types" | absolute_url }}), rather than basing it off of the ingredients’ effects.

While this loses the fun of hunting for specific Critters and Food Ingredients in their respective biomes, it also makes for much simpler bookkeeping – rather than having to record myriad Materials, you just have to record their Rank.
