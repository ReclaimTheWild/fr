*Reclaim the Wild* is built on the idea that Heroes will want to explore and fight enemies for the sake of the Materials they can earn by doing so. However, some groups may prefer to keep players focused on the plot, guarantee a steady income of Materials or Rupees, or simply not wish to spend lots of time foraging for Materials.

If the GM prefers that their game move quickly, and not have the Heroes distracted by sparkling ore, tasty plants, and fluttering insects, we present this rule.

At the end of each Extended Rest, each Hero automatically gains a stipend, based on their Arcana, Civilization, or Nature Trait (depending on the environment they were in), and the chart below.

If the Heroes are in a situation that prevents them from gathering resources (such as being in a town under siege, stuck in prison, or trapped between dimensions), they do not gain their stipend of Materials or Rupees.

Note that the below chart is for most types of Materials; if Food Ingredients are received, multiply the Materials received by 5.

The Heroes may choose which type(s) of Material they receive, within reason, and may split their yield between multiple Material types. The GM may state that some types of Materials are unavailable.

## Materials or Rupees?

The GM and the players should decide before the game begins whether their daily stipend will be in Materials, or simply a payout of Rupees.

If the group wants to still participate in crafting, or worry about which environment they’re in and the Materials available to them, then they should receive their stipend in Materials. This still enables and encourages crafting, while obviating the need to seek out and gather resources.

If the group wants to ignore crafting altogether, and simply obtain their needed supplies from vendors, they should receive their stipend in Rupees. (In this case, the GM should make sure that vendors are plentiful and well-stocked!) This removes both gathering and crafting from the game, and results in a leaner, simpler experience –and as such, should be done with care.
