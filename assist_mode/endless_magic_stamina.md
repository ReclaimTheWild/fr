# Endless Magic & Stamina

Some players or groups may not want to actively track their Bound, Burnt, and Spent Magic and Stamina. If that’s the case for you, we present these rules.

**First, halve the listed cost for all Techniques and Spells, rounding down.** For example, the Spin Attack Technique, which has a listed cost of 8 Stamina, would now have a listed cost of 4 Stamina.

**Feats and Racial Bonuses** that reduce Spell and Technique costs function as written, and their values are NOT halved. They reduce the adjusted listed cost of Spells or Techniques.

**Heroes may now use any Spell or Technique they know that has a listed cost equal to, or less than, their Stamina or Magic Trait.**

For instance, a Hero with 5 points in their Stamina Trait can use Spin Attack as much as they like, while a character with a 3 in their Stamina Trait would be unable to use Spin Attack at all.

**You may only have a single Bound Spell or Technique active at a time.** Having a Spell or Technique Bound does not alter your Stamina or Magic Traits, allowing you to still use high-cost Techniques and Spells while you have your Bound effect active.

**If a Spell or Technique Burns Stamina or Magic**, instead, simply cross it out – that Spell or Technique cannot be used again until you take an Extended Rest. 

When you consume a Dish or Elixir that restores Stamina or Magic, instead restore the use of *one* Burned Spell or Technique.
