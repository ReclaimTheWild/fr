# Repairing and Upgrading Mundane Weapons

Normally, only weapons inhabited by a Weapon Spirit can be repaired or upgraded - attempting to repair or upgrade a mundane weapon simply weakens it by introducing structural flaws, making it unfit for combat. 

However, some people find that having their weapons gradually degrade, and eventually break apart in their hands, is unsatisfying. They may wish to enjoy their weapons forever, without having to worry about finding, buying, or crafting new ones to replace them. On the other hand, the GM may want to run their game more like a traditional fantasy tabletop game, where 
crafting and resource gathering take a back seat to adventure and derring-do. 

Alternatively, a particular mundane weapon may be important to the campaign’s plot or to a Hero's character. Perhaps a weapon was gifted to a Hero by their dying father, or is proof of a lost prince’s lineage. Even though these weapons do not have a Weapon Spirit in them, the GM may decide to allow them to be repaired and reforged, without allowing *all* mundane weapons the same treatment. This should only be done on a case-by-case basis, after discussion with all players – if one player has access to a repairable weapon, other players may see it as an unfair advantage.

Thus, for those people who prefer their weapons never break, for whatever reason, we present the below rules:

**Mundane weapons can be repaired and upgraded**, just like those weapons imbued with Weapon Spirits. Be sure to specify whether this applies to all mundane weapons, or solely those few that the GM deems as particularly important or deserving.

If all mundane weapons can be repaired and upgraded (and not just a rare few weapons that are important to a character or to the plot), **the GM should reduce the Materials gained from Monsters or resources by 1.**

Because crafting and weapon scarcity are integral to a lot of the systems and design balance in Reclaim the Wild, it is unadvisable to remove durability from the game entirely.
