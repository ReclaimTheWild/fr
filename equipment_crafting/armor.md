Armor is worn to increase one’s Defense, to carry Enchantments, and to look fashionable.

Heroes may wear three slots of armor: on their Head, their Torso, and their Legs.

## Armor Weights

Armor comes in four weights: Civilian (also known simply as ‘clothing’), Light, Medium, and Heavy Armor.

Wearing Civilian or Light armor does not impact your Evasion at all.

Wearing Medium armor makes it slightly harder to move around. Your Evasion is reduced by 1 for each piece of Medium Armor you are wearing.

Wearing Heavy armor makes it even harder to move around. Your Evasion is reduced by 2 per piece of Heavy Armor you are wearing.

## Crafting an Armor

Armor can only be created at a Forge.

**You may only craft Armor of a certain rank if (your base Smithing trait) is at least twice its rank** - so a hero with Smithing 5 can craft Rank 0, 1, and 2 Armors, but not Rank 3 Armor, no matter how what materials or time they have.

Armor has a base Material, determined at the time it was crafted. This may be Cloth for Civilian, Light, and Medium Armor, or Metal for Medium and Heavy Armor. (Ancient material can be used for any weight of Armor, including Civilian.) When crafting Armor, at least half of the Materials you use in that process must be of the armor’s Material Type (rounded up). For instance, when forging metal armor, at least half of the materials you use must be Metals. The remaining Materials can be any combination of Ancient, Cloth, Metal, and Monster Parts.

Note that Civilian clothing requires only 5 Materials, while any other kind of Armor – Light, Medium, or Heavy – requires 10.

Materials used in creating an Armor must be equal to or greater than the Rank of the Armor. You cannot use lower-ranked Materials in your Armor. (For instance, when making a Rank 2 Heavy Chest piece, you may use Rank 2, 3, 4, or 5 Materials, but not Rank 0 or 1 Materials.)

Defense provided by a piece of Armor or Clothing of a given Rank:

| Weight   | Rank 0 | Rank 1 | Rank 2 | Rank 3 | Rank 4 | Rank 5 |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Civilian | 0      | 1      | 2      | 3      | 4      | 5      |
| Light    | 1      | 2      | 3      | 4      | 5      | 6      |
| Medium   | 2      | 3      | 4      | 5      | 6      | 7      |
| Heavy    | 3      | 4      | 5      | 6      | 7      | 8      |

Number of Materials to craft armor:

| Weight     | Rank 0 | Rank 1 | Rank 2 | Rank 3 | Rank 4 | Rank 5 |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Civilian   | 5      | 5      | 5      | 5      | 5      | 5      |
| All Others | 10     | 10     | 10     | 10     | 10     | 10     |

In addition, you may be able to purchase already-enchanted Armor. Add the below values to an Armor or Civilian Clothing’s *Market Price* cost, based on the Rank of the Enchantment on the equipment. (This means you should add *double* the below values to the “sell to you” cost, and *half* the below values to the “buy from you” cost.)

| Ench. Rank | Armor Cost | Civilian Cost |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| 0          | +40        | +20           |
| 1          | +80        | +40           |
| 2          | +160       | +80           |
| 3          | +320       | +160          |
| 4          | +800       | +400          |
| 5          | +1600      | +800          |
{: .rtw-table .fixed-columns .centered-bold .width-70 }

Generally – but not necessarily! – when buying enchanted armor, the Enchantment will be at the same Rank as the Armor.
