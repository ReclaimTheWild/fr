## Guardian Arrows

Guardian Arrows are special arrows, infused with the power and technology of the Ancients. When used as part of a Basic Attack (but *not* as part of a Technique, Spell, or Maneuver), a Guardian Arrow will instantly defeat any normal enemy, destroying them utterly. Against Heavy enemies, they count as a Critical Hit. Miniboss or Boss enemies will only take normal damage from Guardian Arrows.

When a Normal or Heavy enemy is defeated by a Guardian Arrow, they are sucked into a swirling sphere of blue energy. This also destroys their Weapons, their Armor, any items they might have had, and prevents you from scavenging their remains. In general, you will not be rewarded for defeating a foe with a Guardian Arrow; in return, you avoid the risk and further loss of time and materiel that fighting them would have caused.

## Silver Arrows

Silver Arrows are especially effective against the forces of evil, and those corrupted by them. Against all others – including those merely deluded, misguided, or doing evil acts for good reasons – they are no more effective than a normal arrow.

Foes who are considered a great evil, or are serving or controlled by a great evil (see [Ancient & Irredeemable Evil]({{ "/introduction#ancient-irredeemable-evil" | absolute_url }})), have a Vulnerability to Silver Arrows. Silver Arrows may also trigger a Boss or Miniboss’s Weak Point, though that varies from foe to foe.

Be sure to speak to your GM (or use the Learn Lore Maneuver!) to know whether a Silver Arrow’s evil-slaying power might be applied against your foes!

## Crafting Arrows

Arrows can be crafted without tools or access to a Forge. When you craft Arrows, select a single piece of Ancient, Metal, or Wood Material to consume. You create the number of Arrows in the chart below, based on the Rank of the Material you used, or (your base Smithing / 2, rounded down), whichever is lower.

| Rank | Arrows Made |
|------|-------------|
| 0    | 2           |
| 1    | 4           |
| 2    | 8           |
| 3    | 16          |
| 4    | 40          |
| 5    | 80          |
{: .rtw-table .fixed-columns .centered-bold .half-width }

To make Broadhead or Hammerhead Arrows, simply cut the numbers above in half.

To craft Showstopper or Snag Arrows, you must consume 1 unit of Luminous Stone or Amber, respectively. The effect is then put on a number of plain Arrows based on the used Gem’s Rank, per the above table. The Rank of the Gem used is capped at (your base Mechanics / 2, rounded down).

To make Elemental Arrows, you must consume 1 Gemstone. That Gem’s associated Element is then applied to a number of plain Arrows based on the Rank of the Gem used, per the above table. Basic Attacks and Techniques made with these arrows take on the associated Element, even if the Weapon the arrow is fired from has the Elemental Weapon Enchantment. The Rank of the Gem used is capped at (your base Enchanting / 2, rounded down).

To make a Bomb Arrow, simply combine 1 Arrow and 1 Bomb to create 1 Bomb Arrow.

The explosive charge on a Bomb Arrow is necessarily smaller than in a full-sized Bomb, and does no additional damage – but it can knock foes backwards with concussive force.

To make a single Guardian Arrow, you must use a unit of Rank 5 Ancient Material and one normal arrow. Creating a Guardian Arrow requires a base Mechanics score of 10.

To make a single Silver Arrow, you must use a unit of Rank 5 Gemstone and one normal arrow. Creating a Silver Arrow requires a base Enchanting of 10.

## Bombs

Bombs are useful explosives. Most are about the size of a person’s head, with a small wick protruding from the top.

Bombs may be placed at one’s feet, thrown like any one-handed weapon, or you may pull them out, light the fuse, and hold on to them until you decide to place or throw them later (or allow them to explode in your hand).

A Bomb’s fuse can be lit without additional tools, as a free action. Bombs explode at the end of the user’s next turn, unless otherwise stated. A Bomb may be held in one’s hand while lit and ticking down.

Bombs can be detonated early by striking them with any Fire or Electric attack, or another Bomb’s explosion. If struck with a Water element attack, a Bomb is harmlessly rendered inert, and is able to be relit. Any other attack safely destroys the bomb without detonating it. Bombs have 10 Evasion, and no Concentration or Vitality.

When thrown (such as down a monster’s throat), Bombs have a Weapon Accuracy of 3. Bombs are one-handed, unless otherwise noted; thus, throwing one is a “Throw 1H” Basic Attack. If thrown on the turn it would explode, a Bomb will detonate upon impact. Bombs can’t be used as part of Techniques.

When rolling To-Hit for additional effects, Bombs do not use their wielder’s Accuracy, but have their own Accuracy Trait of 5. This means their total To-Hit bonus is +8. Bombs do not need to roll To-Hit to inflict damage, only for their additional effects (if any).

**Damage from Bombs ignores Defense.**

**All types of Bombs deal 8 Blunt-type damage in a Burst 1** (including their own square) when they detonate, unless otherwise noted. 

**Bombs hurt both friends and foes.** When they detonate, they affect *everyone* in range. If many Bombs’ explosions are chained together, a creature is only hurt by the Bomb that would most damage them.

If a Bomb is used to Harvest a Resource, reduce the Materials gained by 1.

## List of Bomb Types
