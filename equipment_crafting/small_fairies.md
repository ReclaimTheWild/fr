Heroes can capture Small Fairies and place them into their pack. Small Fairies count as a Consumable, and do not stack – each Small Fairy consumes a single slot of the Pouch.

Small Fairies can be used like any other item, to cast their healing magic on a target within 8 squares. This restores (Target’s Hearts) HP, and removes a single Status Effect of the target’s choice.

When a Hero is at 0 HP or less, at the start of their turn, as a Free Action, they may have one Small Fairy in their Pack escape and use their healing magic on them. This restores (Target’s Hearts) HP, reviving them. It also removes a single Status Effect of their choice, and grants the target the option to immediately stand up from Prone for free.

Small Fairies may also be used to help craft a Dish or Elixir. A Small Fairy’s magic increases the Rank of each Ingredient used in a single Dish or Elixir by 1 (max Rank 5).The Small Fairy does *not* count as an Ingredient in the Dish. Only a single Small Fairy can help with a given Dish or Elixir, and a Small Fairy will only help with a single Dish.

Finally, Small Fairies can be used for a one-time +3 bonus to any Trait Check. You may decide to use a Small Fairy this way *after* you make the roll. Only one Small Fairy may help any given person in any given Trait roll.

No matter how a Small Fairy is used, it immediately flies away afterwards, unable to be recaptured. It will escape even if it would otherwise seem impossible.

## Obtaining Small Fairies

Small Fairies are rare, and often sought-after by Heroes. Small Fairies can theoretically be found anywhere, but there are some ways to get them that Heroes will swear by:

**Slaying powerful evil creatures**. One might appear when a Miniboss is defeated, while more may appear when a true Boss is slain.

**Great Fairies** may summon Small Fairies to aid those who have earned their favor.

**Springs, lakes, and underground grottos** might all hide Small Fairies, but only if the water is crystal-clear, and untouched by evil.

Finally, they might be found, very rarely, in the outdoors – in a bush, behind tall grass, or napping under a serene-looking tree.
