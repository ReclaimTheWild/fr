Weapons and Armors can be Enchanted with useful magical effects, above and beyond the sharpness of their blades or the sturdiness of their stitching.

Enchanting weapons and armor requires access to a Forge. When you apply an Enchantment to a weapon or armor, the Gem used is worked into the item, becoming part and parcel with it.

Each Weapon and Armor can only be given a single Enchantment, with one exception – Weapon Spirits, which can grant their home weapon an additional Enchantment and other effects. See the [Weapon Spirits & Unbreakable Weapons]({{ "/equipment_crafting/natural_weapons_weapon_spirits" | absolute_url }}) section for more.

**Armors and Weapons can only hold an Enchantment of a Rank up to their own Rank, and you may only craft an Enchantment of a Rank equal to (your base Enchanting / 2), rounded down.**

## Cost of Enchanting

**Enchanting a Weapon** costs 1 Gem, and 1 Monster Part, of the Enchantment’s Rank. 

**Enchanting an Armor** costs 1 Gem, and 3 Monster Parts, of the Enchantment’s Rank. (Civilian gear requires only 1 Monster Part.)

In both cases, Gems may replace the Monster Parts, but not the other way around – at least one Gem must be used.

## Enchantments and Stacking

Enchantments of the same type can stack together, along with Dishes or Elixirs that provide the same effect. Simply add up the Ranks of all relevant effects, to get the total Rank of the effect.

Rank 0 effects count as "half a Rank" for stacking purposes. Hence, having two of the same Enchantment at Rank 0 would equal a single Rank 1 Enchantment; having three Rank 0 Enchantments would total up to Rank 1.5 (rounding up to Rank 2).

**No matter what, all effects cap at Rank 5.**

### Example

*Death Mountain has begun erupting, more violently than the Gorons have ever seen. Noir, the Twili bard, needs to travel up the molten slopes and play a magical Song to calm the volcano.*

*Even at the best of times, Death Mountain is under a permanent, deadly Heatwave. Noir decides to enchant some equipment to keep her from collapsing due to heatstroke.*

*First, Noir enchants a Rank 2 Hood with a Rank 2 Weatherproof: Heat enchantment. Then, she enchants a Dagger with a Rank 2 Elemental Weapon (Ice) enchantment, which also grants protection from heatwaves.*

*Combined, this grants her Rank 4 protection from Heatwave weather. However, Noir doesn't want to get sweaty, and so she decides to maximize her protection by cooking up a few Rank 1 Chilly dishes.*

*With a Rank 1 Chilly dish in her belly, a Rank 2 icy weapon in her hand, and a Rank 2 heat-proof Hood on her head, Noir has attained Rank 5 protection against Heatwave weather. Now, even the boiling heat of Death Mountain will feel like a cool breeze.*

## Weapon Enchantments

### Amber-Coated
**Uses**: Amber  
**Equipment Type**: Any Weapon  
**Effect**: You gain (1 + Rank) to all of your Guard Stats versus attempts to inflict Rust or Burning upon this weapon. At Rank 5, this weapon becomes immune to the Burning and Rusted conditions. This weapon won’t take Durability damage from any source except for normal wear and tear – for instance, it won’t take Durability damage when used as a makeshift Tool, or when it’s eaten by a Like Like.

### Attack Up
**Uses**: Any Gem  
**Equipment Type**: Any Weapon  
**Effect**: The weapon’s Attack Power is increased by (Rank + 1).

### Cloying
**Uses**: Sapphire  
**Equipment Type**: Any Weapon  
**Effect**: Rolls To-Hit Concentration made with this weapon are increased by (1+(Rank/2)).

### Critical Hit
**Uses**: Any Gem  
**Equipment Type**: Any Weapon  
**Effect**: Increase this weapon’s Critical Hit range by (1 + (Rank / 2)).

### Durability Up
**Uses**: Any Gem  
**Equipment Type**: Any Weapon  
**Effect**: The weapon’s Durability is increased by (Rank + 1).

### Efficient
**Uses**: Emerald  
**Equipment Type**: Ranged Weapons  
**Effect**: When you make a Basic Attack with this weapon, if your Roll To-Hit was doubles (two 1’s, two 2’s, etc.), and the doubled number is equal to or less than (1 + Rank), then you do not expend the ammunition used in the Basic Attack.

### Elemental Weapon
**Uses**: Varies  
**Equipment Type**: Any Weapon  
**Effect**: The weapon now holds elemental energy, based on the type of Gem used. Basic Attacks and Techniques made with this weapon may take on the element in question, at the wielder’s discretion. (The attack still has the weapon’s Edge type.) When the weapon is used in a Spell, you may pay (half the Magic cost of that Spell) in Stamina to make the Spell take on that element.

Replacing an attack’s element will also replace all named Status Effects a Spell or Technique inflicts on foes (except Distracted) with that element’s Status Effect, per the chart below.

Further, the weapon provides an additional benefit to its wielder while it is held or on the Hero’s hip (but not when stored in their Pack).

Finally, the user gains access to the Elemental Chaff attack, below.

**Elemental Chaff**
**Cost**: 6 Stamina  
**Use Requirement**: A Weapon with the Elemental Weapon Enchantment  
**Range**: Blast 2 (Arcane Weapons), Cone 2 (Melee Weapons), Line 4 (Ranged Weapons)  
**Damage**: Weapon + (Enchantment Rank), of the weapon’s Element  
**Effect**: Roll To-Hit target’s Concentration; on success, target is inflicted with the element’s corresponding status effect (see the table below).

| Gemstone | Element | Status Effect | Additional Effects        |
|----------|---------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Diamond  | Light   | Cursed Casts  | Fair Light, radius (Rank) |
| Emerald  | Earth   | Rusted Resist | Rain (Rank)               |
| Onyx     | Dark    | Sick          | Exudes black smoke*       |
| Opal     | Water   | Soaked        | Resist Sandstorm (Rank)   |
| Ruby     | Fire    | On Fire       | Resist Coldsnap (Rank)    |
| Sapphire | Ice     | Slowed        | Resist Heatwave (Rank)    |
| Topaz    | Shock   | Off-Balance   | Generates electricity     |
{: .rtw-table }

**Onyx weapons exude a black smoke that can obscure vision when held steady (IE, placed on the ground, or when held by a user who is not in combat). This smoke may fill a single square, and generally prevents light from shining through. Perception checks made through the smoke take a (Rank) penalty, and light sources within the smoke have their Rank (or radius) reduced by (Rank).*

### Forceful
**Uses**: Ruby  
**Equipment Type**: Any Weapon  
**Effect**: Rolls To-Hit Vitality made with this weapon are increased by (1 + (Rank / 2)).

### Hydrodynamic
**Uses**: Opal  
**Equipment Type**: Any Weapon  
**Effect**: If fighting while underwater, foes are not Hard to Hit simply because you are not a Natural Swimmer. If this weapon is a Ranged Weapon, Fire and Bomb Arrows shot from it work just as well as they would on dry land. This weapon does not suffer ill effects from being exposed to fresh or salt water.

### Loyal
**Uses**: Topaz  
**Equipment**: Any Weapon  
**Effect**: As a Minor Action, you may call this weapon to your empty hand. The weapon must be within line of sight, and must be able to pass through the intervening space between itself and your hand. If the weapon is held by another creature, you may make a Disarm attempt against the Creature as part of this Minor Action, with a bonus equal to the Enchantment's Rank.

### Mirrored
**Uses**: Diamond  
**Equipment Type**: Any Weapon  
**Effect**: When you Parry or Deflect with this weapon, your Defense is increased by (Rank) for this attack (before reducing the damage from Deflect or Parry). The foe that attacked you takes (Rank) damage, unmitigated by Defense.

### Multi-Shot
**Uses**: Onyx  
**Equipment Type**: Any Weapon  
**Effect**: When you do a Ranged Basic Attack with this weapon, fire (1 + (Rank / 2)) mini-shots, with your original attack’s range, each dealing (1+Rank) damage, ignoring Defense.

Mini-shots must be fired at foes other than your original target(s), and each mini-shot must target a different foe. (These targeting rules do not apply when attacking Swarms.)

Mini-Shots do not consume ammunition, and they do not require a Roll To-Hit to land, but cannot strike anything that is Hard to Hit. Damage-reducing Reactions reduce the damage of a mini-shot to zero. Mini-shots cannot take on the properties of ammunition, Enchantments, or other additional effects.

Any additional mini-shots not used by the end of your turn disappear.

### Perfectly Balanced
**Uses**: Any Gem  
**Equipment Type**: Any Weapon  
**Effect**: The weapon’s Attack Power, Durability, Accuracy, and Critical Hit range are increased, as per the table below.

| Rank | ACC | ATK | DUR | CRIT |
|------|-----|-----|-----|------|
| 0    | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0    |
| 1    | 0   | 2   | 1   | 0    |
| 2    | 1   | 2   | 2   | 1    |
| 3    | 1   | 3   | 2   | 1    |
| 4    | 2   | 3   | 3   | 2    |
| 5    | 2   | 4   | 3   | 2    |
{: .rtw-table .fixed-columns .centered-bold .half-width }

### Quickshot
**Uses**: Topaz  
**Equipment Type**: Any Weapon  
**Effect**: When you make a Ranged Basic Attack using this weapon, roll ((2 x Rank) + Weapon’s ACC) vs. target’s Concentration; on success, they may not use Reactions against that attack.

### Silvered
**Uses**: Diamond  
**Equipment Type**: Any Weapon  
**Effect**: Foes who are considered a great evil (see [Ancient & Irredeemable Evil]({{ "/introduction#ancient-irredeemable-evil" | absolute_url }})), or are serving or controlled by a great evil, have a Vulnerability to this weapon. This weapon may also trigger a foe’s Weak Point. (These effects only occur if the foe’s Rank is equal to or less than this Enchantment’s; otherwise, this Enchantment does nothing.)

### Tracer
**Uses**: Luminous Stone  
**Equipment Type**: Any Weapon  
**Effect**: When you land a Ranged Basic Attack using this weapon, your target is illuminated until the end of your next turn. While lit up, they cast Radius (Rank) Dim Light and lose (Rank / 2) Evasion.
