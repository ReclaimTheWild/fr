All weapons have an Attack Power, a Durability rating, and an Accuracy. This is determined by the Weapon’s Type, the Weapon’s Rank, and the style in which the crafter made the item.

Weapon Type determines what kind of weapon it is – a sword, a spear, a boomerang, a bow, and so on. This also helps determine its stats; for instance, a Greatsword does more damage than a Sword, but is slightly less accurate.

Weapons also have a Rank, from 0 to 5. The higher a weapon’s Rank is, the more damage it does, the more Durability it has, and the more valuable it is.

Finally, Weapons can be made in certain Crafting Styles. This modifies the Weapon’s stats further. For instance, a Goron weapon is sturdier than most of its type, but is also less deadly. **Weapons may only have, at most, a single Crafting Style.**

## Crafting a Weapon

Weapons can only be created at a Forge.

**You may only craft Weapons of a certain rank if (your base Smithing trait) is at least twice its rank** - so a hero with Smithing 5 can craft Rank 0, 1, and 2 Weapons, but not Rank 3 Weapons, no matter what materials or time they have.

Weapons have a Material Type: a Weapon is either Ancient, Metallic, or Wooden, based on the type of Material that makes up the majority (at least 50%) of the weapon when it is crafted. A weapon must have one, and only one, majority Material defining its type. The remaining Material cost of the weapon may be paid for with Ancient, Metal, Monster Parts, or Wood Materials.

Materials used in creating a Weapon must be equal to or greater than the Rank of the Weapon. You cannot use lower-ranked Materials in your Weapon. (For instance, when making a Rank 2 Sword, you may use Rank 2, 3, 4, or 5 Materials, but not Rank 0 or 1 Materials.)

Different weapon types have different modifiers on their Attack Power and Durability, and have different Accuracy scores. Consult the chart on the next page to see how a weapon’s type alters its Accuracy, Attack, and Durability. (For instance, while a Rank 2 Sword has an Attack Power of 9, a Rank 2 Greatsword has an Attack Power of 10.)

Finally, if you know a Crafting Style, you may apply it to the weapon during its creation (but never afterwards). This further modifies its Material cost, Attack Power, Durability, Accuracy, and may also grant it additional special properties. 

When all is said and done, no Weapon may have an Attack Power, Durability, or Accuracy of less than 1.

Once you’ve made your weapon, you may also describe and name it, if you like!

## An Example

*Torvan, the chivalrous Zora knight, decides to craft a new Sledge. His Smithing Trait is at Rank 6, meaning he is capable of crafting up to Rank 3 Weapons. He has several units of Knuckle Alloy (a Rank 3 Metal), as well as many Monster Parts, and access to a suitable Forge.*

*To begin with, a Rank 3 Weapon has an Attack Power of 12, and a Durability of 12. As a Sledge, however, the weapon is a little more durable, and less powerful: a typical Rank 3 Sledge has only 12 Attack Power, but a Durability of 15 – a low-damage, long-lasting two-handed weapon. All Sledges have a below-average Accuracy bonus of 2.*

*All Weapons require 5 units of Material of their Rank, and at least half of those must be Ancient, Wood or Metal (and Torvan is using Knuckle Alloy, a Metal material). However, Torvan knows how to craft in the Gerudo style, and decides to use those teachings here. The weapon will be more powerful (with 2 more Attack Power), but will cost and extra unit of material to create – a price Torvan is willing to pay. Thus, he'll use three units of Knuckle Alloy, and three Rank 3 Monster Parts, to make his weapon. He could have used more Knuckle Alloy instead, but not less – at least half the weapon's cost must be paid in metal to make a Metal weapon.*

*After some time at the Forge, Torvan creates a Rank 3 Sledge in the Gerudo style. It has an Attack Power of 14, a Durability of 15, and an Accuracy of 2. Torvan names his new weapon a “Sunfury Sledgehammer”, and describes it as an ornate golden warhammer with a long silver handle.*

*Now, perhaps he can interest an ally in Enchanting it for him...*

*All types of Weapons may be Thrown.*

NOTE, Ranged Weapons: Bows and Crossbows are usually Piercing weapons (when you fire an Arrow from them). Some arrow types may alter this. If a Ranged Weapon is thrown, it is Blunt.

NOTE, Fists: Fist weapons can be either Blunt, Piercing, or Sharp, determined when the item is first made. 

**Defensive** weapons allow you to use the Deflect Reaction. In exchange, they cannot be used to Parry.

**Hands-Free** weapons allow you to hold another non-weapon item, climb, or otherwise do things with the same hand(s) as that weapon. They also grant a bonus of (Weapon's Rank / 2) to performing Combat Maneuvers.

**Long** weapons let you use the Stab Basic Attack, and let you use Combat Maneuvers from 2 squares away.

**Returning** weapons will come back to your hand when thrown, immediately after resolving the attack. When a Returning weapon comes back to you, you instantly re-equip it to the hand(s) it was in previously.

**Sweeping** weapons allow you to use the Sweep Basic Attack, and allow the use of Combat Maneuvers with a Range of Sweep 2.

**Wizardly** weapons grant you a (Weapon's Rank / 2) bonus to Willpower when using them to cast a Spell of any type.

## Buying and Selling Weapons

*Prices for buying and selling weapons (at full Durability, without Enchantments)*

| Weapon Rank | Merchants will buy from you for... | Market Value | Will sell to you for... |
|------------ |------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Rank 0      | 25                                 | 50           | 100                     |
| Rank 1      | 50                                 | 100          | 200                     |
| Rank 2      | 100                                | 200          | 400                     |
| Rank 3      | 200                                | 400          | 800                     |
| Rank 4      | 500                                | 1000         | 2000                    |
| Rank 5      | 1000                               | 2000         | 4000                    |
{: .rtw-table .fixed-columns .centered-bold }

Weapons with Enchantments will cost more. If the Enchantment on a Weapon is the same Rank as the Weapon, its Market Value will increase by 40% (the cost of two Materials).

Weapons in Crafting Styles that use more or fewer Materials than normal will cost more or less: increase or decrease their Market Value by 20% for each extra Material used.

These additional costs add up – for instance, a Gerudo-style enchanted scimitar costs 60% more than a plain sword!

## Used Weapons

Most merchants will only sell you pristine, never-been-used weapons. Some, however, will sell previously-used or battle-tested weapons, at a discount. However, any merchant worth his or her salt will refuse to pay a Hero full price for a sword that is about to fall apart!

An item’s price is further modified by the remaining Durability of the Weapon in question, as a percentage. For instance, a weapon that has lost 40% of its durability will be worth 40% less, both to purchase from, and to sell to, a merchant. (Some merchants will only worry about this in 20% increments, rounding down against the hero’s favor, but some exacting Game Masters might find it easier to just take up a calculator and use the exact percentage.)

## Crafting Styles

Weapons can be crafted in a variety of styles, each born from the history and culture of a different race. Heroes can learn to craft in these styles by learning [Feats]({{ "/feats_spells_techniques/feats" | absolute_url }}). (See the Feats section for info.)

Below is a reference table of Crafting Styles presented in this book, and their effects on weapons.

## Improvised Weapons

On occasion, a Hero may find themselves without a weapon at-hand – and use whatever’s handy as an improvised weapon.

When a Hero takes up an improvised weapon, the GM must determine what weapon type it is most akin to, to serve as the improvised weapon’s weapon type. For instance, a soup ladle might be akin to a Club, and a pot-lid might make a handy impromptu Shield.

Improvised weapons are always considered Rank 0, even if they are made from the finest of materials. This means they provide little extra damage, but they allow a Hero to use their attacks, and to Parry or Deflect blows.

Generally, any improvised weapon will only have a single unit of Durability, breaking after the end of the current combat encounter. If the item was designed to suffer significant wear and tear, it may have up to 3 Durability.
