# Where You Can Craft

Weapons, Armor, and some Tools can only be crafted and enchanted at a Forge. Forges are typically found in towns – you may need to barter or cajole your way into being allowed to use them, or grateful townspeople may give heroes use of their forges for free, to show their appreciation or to better prepare them to help solve their problems.

To cook Food and Elixirs, you must have access to a Cooking Vessel and a source of heat. Cooking Vessels are found in towns, but also in many smaller bastions of civilization, such as roadside stables, inns, and points of interest. You can also purchase or craft a Portable Cooking Vessel, enabling you to make meals over a campfire.

Inventory Pouches do not require access to a Forge to be crafted. However, crafting a whole-new Pack (for a trusty steed or sidekick) does require a Forge.

Enchanting a piece of equipment also requires access to a Forge.

You can deconstruct Weapons, Armor, and Tools wherever you find yourself – it’s much easier to take apart than it is to make. This can be handy if you find yourself with far too many items to take back to town, and don’t want to leave your loot behind.

Crafting, deconstruction, and other similar actions, can *typically* only be done during a Short or Extended Rest. There is no limit to how much crafting you can do during a rest.
