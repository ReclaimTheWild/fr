While Heroes can obtain all Materials by exploring the wild and defeating Monsters, they may find themselves short of a needed Type of Material, or unable to find a Material of a particular Rank. In those cases, Heroes can Transmute Materials to suit their needs.

Transmutation is an inefficient process. In terms of sheer value, buying and selling Materials is more efficient than Transmutation â€“ but that depends on a Merchant being available, and that Merchant having the desired Materials at all.

Transmutation requires the use of a Forge.

A Hero may take 10 pieces of a single Type of Material (such as Metal, Wood, or Cloth), and turn them into a single piece of that same Type of Material, of the next Rank up. They may only create Materials of a Rank up to (base Enchanting / 2, rounded down) with this method.

You cannot create or use Ancient Materials, Critters, or Food Ingredients through Transmutation.

Further, a Hero may turn 5 units of a single Type and Rank of Material into a single unit of a different Material, at the same Rank. You may use this to change Metal into Cloth, for example, or an Onyx into a Ruby. Heroes may only do this on Materials of a Rank up to (base Enchanting / 2, rounded down).

## Example

*Noir, the Twili bard, has just left Death Mountain with tons of Metal that she doesn't need. She decides to Transmute them.*

*She takes 5 pieces of Soldier Steel (a Rank 2 Metal), and transforms them into a single piece of Sakado Cotton (a Rank 2 Cloth).*

*Fortunately, she already had 9 pieces Sakado Cloth to go with it, so now she has 10! Unfortunately, Noir only has an Enchanting Trait of 4, which is not high enough to combine those 10 pieces of Sakado Cloth into a single piece of Hytopian Silk (Rank 3 Cloth).*
