# Deconstructing Equipment

Weapons, Armor, and Tools can be deconstructed, to regain some of their base materials. This can be done during any Short or Extended Rest, whether or not you have access to a Forge.

When deconstructed, a Weapon, Civilian Clothing, or Mundane Tool returns 1 unit of material, of its Rank and Material Type; a piece of Light, Medium, or Heavy Armor returns 2. For instance, deconstructing a Rank 3 Wooden Boomerang would return one unit of Rank 3 Wood; taking apart a Rank 2 metal helm would return two pieces of Rank 2 Metal.

If the Weapon, Civilian Clothing, or Armor you are deconstructing has an Enchantment, you may **also** obtain a single Gem, of the deconstructed Enchantment’s Rank. The Gem’s Type is the same as the Type of Gem used to originally enchant the item – for instance, deconstructing a weapon with the Forceful Enchantment (which requires using a Ruby) will always yield a Ruby.

You cannot deconstruct *just* the Enchantment on a piece of equipment – you can only break the whole thing apart. You may, however, overwrite an Enchantment, enchanting the equipment as if it had no original Enchantment.
