While any Weapon can be used for spells, **when you use a Wizardly weapon (like a Rod or Staff) to cast a Spell, your Willpower is increased by (Weapon's Rank / 2) for __all__ purposes of the Spell.** Casting a Spell while making use of this bonus counts as successfully using that weapon, for the purposes of calculating Durability damage at the end of a fight.

When a Spell says its cost is (Willpower) Magic, you may choose to spend less than that, resulting in a less powerful spell. (All Spells with a cost based on the caster’s Willpower have at least one effect that is based on the Magic spent on the spell.)

This Disarm attempt must target the metallic weapon that struck you.

The effect persists even through Short or Extended Rests, so long as you keep the Magic cost bound. This disguise can be seen through with the Lens of Truth spell.

### Jabu-Jabu’s Switchhook

**Cost**: 12 Magic (Bind)  
**Range**: 1 square within 8 squares  
**Effect**: The air solidifies into a 2-square tall, 1-square wide block of solid lightning. This block can be pushed, climbed or stood on, but only by its caster. It is immobile and intangible to all others.

Any creature entering or starting their turn in the block’s space takes (your Willpower) Shock damage. 

A block can be destroyed by its caster as a Minor Action. This causes the block to implode, Spending the Magic, and dealing (Weapon + (3 x Willpower)) Shock damage to any creature inside it.

This spell does not reveal the truth behind non-magical deceptions.

While active, you may re-cast this spell as a Free Action.

### Magnesis
3 Tokens  
**Cost**: 4 Magic  
**Range**: 1 metallic target within 8 squares  
**Effect**: You may move a single metallic creature or object in a direction you choose: up, down, side to side, towards or away from you. The object must stay within the spell’s range, or it immediately falls to the ground. Your magnetic grip on the object lasts until the start of your next turn; you may then re-cast Magnesis again to keep your magnetic grip uninterrupted.

To determine how heavy an object you can move, calculate [your 2h Lifting capacity]({{ "/character_traits#lifting" | absolute_url }}), using Willpower instead of Athletics. If the object’s weight is less than your “2h Burdened” weight, you may move it up to 3 squares; if it’s less than your “2h Easy” weight, you may move it up to 6 squares.

Magnesis is a spell with lots of potential uses. Below are some common examples!
- If you attempt to slow down a creature wearing metal armor, Roll To-Hit target’s Vitality; on success, the creature is Slowed until the end of their next turn.
- If you attempt to wield a metallic weapon at range with this spell, you may only use Basic Attacks with it, substituting your Willpower for Combat.
- You may draw an unattended metallic item to or from an empty hand with this spell, immediately equipping it.
- You may pull yourself towards a heavy metallic creature or object in a direct line, at a rate of 6 squares per turn. You take 2 damage for each square of Difficult Terrain you pass, ignoring Defense.
- If you attempt to take a metallic object from another creature’s hands, make a Disarm attempt, using Arcana in place of your Combat. On success, the item is yanked from the creature’s hands, and you may move it up to 3 squares away from the target. If you fail, your magnetic hold on the object ends.

You cannot use this spell on anything that is rooted, glued, nailed down, mortared, or otherwise firmly secured.

If you target a hostile creature or an object held by a hostile creature, you must roll To-Hit the target’s Concentration to successfully cast Sol's Gleam on the target.

While merged with the shadow, you can see, hear, and speak, but you cannot interact with objects, or take any Actions (Standard, Move, Minor, or Reaction), except to end this spell. You cannot be harmed by any physical attack, though magical attacks will harm you and cause you to be revealed, ending the spell. You cannot move, but if your shadow’s source moves, then you are carried along with it. If your shadowy spot is exposed to Bright Light or otherwise ceases to be, you are immediately revealed and the spell ends. You may end the spell as a Minor Action. This spell ends when you take a Short or Extended Rest.
