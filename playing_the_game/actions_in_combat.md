# Actions in Combat

Each round of Combat, you have four types of actions: **Standard, Move, Minor,** and **Reactions.**

**Standard** actions are the most important and impactful: Basic Attacks, most Maneuvers, and most Spells and Techniques, are Standard actions, unless otherwise noted. You can only perform a single Standard action per turn. You may use your Standard to instead perform a Minor action.

**Minor** actions are smaller, but still useful: Swapping inventory, some Spells and Techniques, or using an item are all Minor actions. You can perform a single Minor action per turn, though you can choose to use a Standard action to perform a Minor action instead.

**Move** actions are simply when your character moves. While you can move multiple times in a single turn, you have limited pool of Movement points (usually 6), regardless of what method of travel you use (walking, swimming, flying, etc.). You can spend that Movement across multiple Move actions during your turn.

**Reactions** are things that you perform while it’s not your turn – typically, actions that help mitigate incoming attacks. You can perform an unlimited number of Reactions per round of combat, but **you can only perform *any given* Reaction *once* per round.** Your Reactions refresh at the beginning of your turn.

There are also **Free** actions, which are simply things that don’t consume any other action type. These tend to be very small and quick actions, such as drawing or sheathing a weapon, or speaking aloud. You can perform an infinite number of Free actions during your turn – or at least, as many as the GM’s patience will allow.
