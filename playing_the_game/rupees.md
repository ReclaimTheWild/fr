# Rupees

Rupees are the legal tender of choice for the land of Hyrule, and are accepted by the peddlers of many other kingdoms, as well. Lightweight, durable, and hard to counterfeit, Rupees are a safe and convenient currency.

Rupees are gemstones, each about the size of a person’s thumb. They are smooth to the touch, and shaped like elongated hexagons. When tapped against another Rupee, they make a pleasing chime. Quite literally, they are music to a merchant’s ears.

An individual Rupee’s value is based on its color. In general, the rarer that color is, the more valuable the Rupee. Through a long and storied tradition among merchants, the nominal value of these differently-colored Rupees has long been set in place.

To the right are listed the most common colors of Rupee, and their proscribed value. 

| Rupee's Color | Value          |
|---------------|----------------|
| Green         | 1 Rupee        |
| Blue          | 5 Rupees       |
| Red           | 20 Rupees      |
| Purple        | 50 Rupees      |
| Silver        | 100 Rupees     |
| Gold          | 300 Rupees     |

Just because Rupees have a set value, doesn’t mean you can’t get a good deal.  
See the [Prices & Haggling]({{ "/supply_demand/prices_haggling" | absolute_url }}) section for info.

Though not magical in and of themselves, Rupees can serve as a conduit for some particularly obscure spells. Heroes have found puzzles in tombs that require them to pick up specific Rupees found in hard-toreach spots, rewarding them with both spending cash and progress through the dungeon. They have also found Rupoors, blackened corruptions of Rupees that magically remove money from one’s wallet when touched, before disappearing in a puff of spite. Finally, some esoteric Magical Tools might use their wielder’s Rupees, rather than their Magic or Stamina, to fuel their effects.
