## Equipment Slots

A Hero has the following equipment slots:
- Head armor
- Torso armor
- Leg armor
- Belt 1
- Belt 2
- Belt 3
- Belt 4
- Pack

**Head, Torso, and Leg slots** contain a Hero’s armor, providing them Defense to help negate incoming damage. These armor pieces can also be enchanted, providing additional effects.

**Belt 1, Belt 2, Belt 3, and Belt 4** are the items the Hero has readied on their belt. These items can be put in an empty hand (left or right) as a Free Action. Items that are In-Hand can be used as intended, whether as weapons ready to cut down foes and obstacles, or as tools to climb walls or harvest wood. You can have up to two onehanded items, or one two-handed item, In-Hand. In-Hand Items still occupy their respective Belt slots.

**Pack** is the Hero’s inventory, with everything they’re carrying. Items in the Pack cannot be used without first being pulled from the Pack as a Minor Action.

Your Pack has a limited amount of room in it for some kinds of items, such as Weapons and Armor. Be sure to consider increasing the size of your Pack, to help you carry more loot and useful equipment! See the [Inventory: Packs & Pouches]({{ "/equipment_crafting/packs_pouches" | absolute_url }}) section for more information.

## Sheathing and Belt Items

A Hero’s four Belt Slots represent items that they are ready to use. These slots may hold one item each, no matter its size (so a single slot could hold an Elixir, a Greatsword, a Shovel, or a Shield), and the Hero may swap which item(s) are In-Hand as a Free Action during their turn. **You may only swap items if you have not yet taken a Standard Action this turn.**

You may have no items In-Hand, leaving the hands free to hold things or do work, such as pushing blocks around, pulling a lever, or grabbing an unattended item and briefly using it before dropping it or putting it back. However, after that, no more items can be sheathed into Belt slots – they must be put into the Pack if they are to be kept.

## Inventory Management

As a Minor Action, you may move one item from your Pack to your hand, your hand to your Pack, or swap one item in your hand(s) for one in your Pack.

As a Standard Action, you may swap one piece of currently-worn armor for a piece of armor in your Pack, equipping it.

## Picking up Items

As a Minor Action, you may pick up a single unattended item from the ground. If you have sufficiently empty hands to hold or wield the item, you may immediately do so for free.

If you do not have sufficiently empty hands to hold or wield the item, or if you simply wish to immediately place it in your Pack, then the item goes into your Pack.

## Using Items

An item must first be in your hand for you to use it. (Remember that you can swap items to and from your belt for free.)

Unless the item says otherwise, using an item from your hand on yourself or on the ground is a Minor Action. This could be drinking an elixir, setting a bomb, etc.

Typically, using an item on another person, friend or foe, is a Standard Action. This could be applying an elixir to a fallen ally, throwing a bomb at a group of enemies, etc.

You may use an item on yourself, or a target within melee range, unless the item in question says otherwise.

## Reloading and Ammunition

When you fire a Bow or Crossbow (or any weapon that uses ammunition), you may choose at that moment what ammunition to use. There is no cost to reloading.

Techniques and Spells do not use arrows, and cannot be affected by special ammo. If a Technique or Spell calls to use a Basic Attack with a Ranged Weapon, however, those Basic Attacks do use arrows.

When Boomerangs (or other Returning weapons) are thrown, you may catch them on the return trip, immediately re-equipping them to the hand they left. If you cannot perform Reactions (such as by being Off-Balance), the Boomerang merely lands at your feet, in the square you occupy.

If you throw a non-Returning weapon, it lands beneath or beside the target, whether the attack hits or misses. If you wish to throw another weapon, you’ll have to go pick it up, or pull another weapon from your Pack.
