# Luck Rolls

Sometimes, the GM may call for a Luck Roll. This might be to help determine what treasure is in a treasure chest, the results of a game of chance or gambling game, or just to tip the scales when they arenâ€™t sure if something good or bad should happen. 

A Luck roll is simply a 2d6, without a Trait or any modifiers. However, they may be modified by circumstances, as per your GM. For instance, if used for determining the loot in a treasure chest, the chest itself might be particularly lucky (or, having already been picked over, particularly unlucky).

Luck rolls use a different DC schema, presented below.

| Die Roll | Luck Roll Result |
|----------|------------------|
| 02       | Exceptionally Unlucky.<br>All your friends should stand clear... |
|03-04     | Very Unlucky.<br>Bad things are in store for your future... |
|05-06     | Somewhat Unlucky.<br>Well, it could be worse... |
|07        | Break Even.<br>Nothing bad, but nothing good. |
|08-09     | Somewhat Lucky.<br>You have a good feeling! |
|10-11     | Very Lucky.<br>Something good is about to happen! |
|12        | Exceptionally Lucky.<br>You just hit the jackpot! |
