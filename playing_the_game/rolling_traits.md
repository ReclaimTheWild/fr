When it comes time for Heroes to test their skills, the GM first decides how difficult the task will be, selecting a Difficulty Check (DC) based on the chart below. Then, the Hero(es) in question roll 2d6, plus the relevant Trait, plus or minus any modifiers. They then compare that number to the challenge’s DC: if the roll meets or exceeds the DC, then they succeed; otherwise, they fail.

Some Trait checks are opposed rolls: a Hero rolls against another creature, who is also rolling a Trait. In these cases, the two creatures involved in the check roll at the same time, and compare their results. In an opposed Trait check, the creature with the higher number wins.

**Ties go to the ‘aggressor’** – the one who initiated the check. For instance, if you face a challenge with a DC of 10, and you roll a 10, then you succeed – albeit, barely.

A roll of 1 on each die is *not* an automatic failure, but can certainly be played up for laughs. It should not cause additional pain and suffering beyond failure, though. Similarly, rolling two 6’s is not an automatic success, but can be played up as a moment of epic, astounding competence.

## Typical DCs

| Difficulty Name | DC | Description |
|-----------------|----|-------------|
| Effortless      | 4  | Only the most incompetent or disadvantaged person could possibly fail this. Why even bother rolling? |
|Novice           | 7  | An extremely simple task. Even a dunce would succeed at this half the time, and an average person would rarely have issue. |
| Journeyman      | 10 | A mundane task that requires some skill or tools for an average person to reliably accomplish. Almost any Hero can handle this task.
| Adept           | 13 | A somewhat difficult task, but one that a skilled and well-equipped person, or a novice Hero, could overcome.
| Expert          | 16 | A real challenge, where average people (or inexperienced Heroes) begin to consider calling in seasoned Heroes or experts instead.
| Impressive      | 19 | Impossible for the average person without lots of skill and equipment. Even seasoned Heroes and experts will break a sweat.
| Heroic          | 22 | A Hero at the top of their game would struggle, and need to prepare, for this challenge.
| Legendary       | 25+ | Only a legendary Hero, who was master of their craft, with the best preparation and tools, could accomplish this task. |
