Stamina and Magic can be used in three ways: Bind, Spend, or Burn.
**Spent** Stamina and Magic functions quite simply: you can spend points up to your maximum, but no further. When points are spent, they will return at the end of the encounter or scene.

**Bound** Stamina and Magic is ‘tied up’ in whatever effect it was used for. If the effect ends, the Stamina or Magic is returned to the user immediately, and can be used howsoever they like. Some Bind effects will have conditions where the Bound Stamina or Magic are then Spent or Burned, rather than returning to the user.

A creature may end any Bound effect(s) in their control as a Free Action on their turn. If a creature with Bound Stamina or Magic is knocked unconscious, all of their Bound effects immediately end, returning thatStamina or Magic to them.

**Burned** Stamina and Magic is a slightly more permanent cost: while Spent points return when the Hero catches their breath (typically the end of a battle or scene), Burned points will return only during an Extended Rest, or from consuming Food or Elixirs.

**When reducing the cost** of Spells or Techniques, do percentile reductions first, one at a time (don't add percentages together). Then, apply flat cost reductions. 

If the final cost ends in a .5, round the total cost down. A Spell or Technique’s cost can’t be reduced below 1 Magic or Stamina.  
(Some Spells or Techniques may have a cost that starts at 0).

## A Note on Temporary Points

**Temporary Points cannot be Bound or Burned.** They are Spent before ‘actual’ Health, Stamina, or Magic. 

A Hero cannot have more Temporary Health, Stamina, or Magic than the Hero has an actual maximum of. 

For instance, a Hero with 3 Hearts (12 HP max) could only have 12 Temporary Health at a given moment. 

Temporary Points from multiple sources stack: eating a Dish that grants 8 Temporary Health, after resting in a comfortable bed that provides 4 Temporary Health, would grant a Hero a total of 12 Temporary Health.

Unused Temporary Points disappear at the beginning of a Short or Extended Rest.
