# Master Mode

Master Mode is a collection of optional rules for *Reclaim the Wild*, much like Assist Mode – however, these rules are intended to make the game *more* complex or difficult.

These rules are not intended for every game – rather, they’re intended to be used only after the GM and the players have discussed the additional rules, and their ramifications. **By default, games run in *Reclaim the Wild* do NOT use Master Mode rules.**

Master Mode rules can be applied to a game as a whole, or the GM may choose to use some rules, and discard others. Some can even be combined with Assist Mode rules, to make your game truly unique. GMs should be very clear with their players about which optional rules are (or are not) in use!

In general, Master Mode rules allow the game to take on a stronger aspect of survival: they require Heroes to eat to keep up their strength, to display cohesive tactics when in combat, to tend to their wounds after a battle, and to seek out more resources than they otherwise would need in a non-Master Mode game.
