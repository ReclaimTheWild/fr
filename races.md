# Races

The measure of a Hero might be in their Power, Wisdom, and Courage, but their Race helps determine what they can do, what skills they might have learned, and their upbringing.

All Races have a Vulnerability to a specific Element. When they take damage of that Element, they suffer an additional 4 damage, and that extra damage ignores your Defense, so be wary of your Vulnerability!

All Races have benefits unique to them, listed in each Race’s Overview – these could be immunities to certain weathers or terrain, knowledge of Spells or Techniques that other Races find harder to come by, the ability to fly or swim with ease, or even more esoteric advantages.
