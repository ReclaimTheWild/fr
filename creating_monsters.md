# Creating Monsters

The world of Hyrule has hundreds, if not thousands, of different kinds of monsters inhabiting it. In fact, there are far too many kinds of monsters to simply catalogue them all in an appendix, or even a full book!

As such, the GM for a game of *Reclaim the Wild* will need to be able to create their own foes for the Heroes to take on.
