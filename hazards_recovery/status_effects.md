### **Boosted Trait**
Boosts always come with a rank. The Trait(s) in question is/are increased by 1 for each Rank of the effect. (You cannot use a boosted Trait to qualify for Feats, Spells, or Techniques, or to determine what Rank of items you can craft.)

### **Blinded**
While Blinded, you can’t see at all. You fail all sight-based Perception checks, and all foes are Extremely Hard to Hit (see below). Being Blinded ends at the end of your next turn, unless otherwise specified. Mini-Bosses and Bosses are merely Dazzled.

### **Burning**
While a weapon is Burning, all attacks made with it are Critical Hits, even if they automatically hit. Further, all attacks do Fire-type damage, regardless of their usual damage type. The weapon also casts Dim Light as a lit torch of its Rank would. The weapon loses 1 Durability at the start of your turn, and 1 Durability from every foe it hits. (If the attack hits multiple targets, you only hit as many targets as you have Durability remaining.) A Burning weapon can be extinguished as a Minor Action, or by storing it in your pack. Burning weapons are also extinguished when you are Soaked, hit with a Water-type attack, or by entering water. Only Wooden weapons can begin Burning. (Fire-enchanted Wooden weapons don’t light themselves on fire.)

### **Cursed**
While you are Cursed, you cannot use any Basic Attacks, Techniques, or Spells. You can still move, use tools and items (but not to directly attack), speak, perform Maneuvers and Basic Reactions, and otherwise take action. Mini-Bosses and Bosses instead do (Monster’s Rank + 1) less damage with their attacks, but suffer no limits on actions they can take. Curses last until the end of your next turn, unless stated.

### **Dazzled**
While Dazzled, you cannot see clearly. You suffer a -2 penalty to any sight-based Perception checks, and all foes are Hard to Hit (see below). Being Dazzled ends at the end of your next turn, unless otherwise specified.

### **Distracted**
When Distracted, all foes are Hard to Hit (see below), except for the source of your Distraction. If you are Distracted by multiple things, then none of your Distracting foes are Hard to Hit. If the source of your Distraction would otherwise be Hard to Hit, they no longer are; if they would be Extremely Hard to Hit, they are instead merely Hard to Hit.

### **Electrified**
When Electrified, any metallic or natural weapons that come in contact with you will conduct electricity into their user. Anyone who attacks you with a metallic or natural melee weapon suffers Shock damage equal to half the resultant damage they inflict upon you. This damage is not modified by their Defense, though it is modified by Vulnerability or Resistance to Shock.

### **Frozen**
While Frozen, you cannot take action, and are Halted. The next (non-Fire) attack to connect with you is automatically a Critical Hit, and releases you from being Frozen. You may wriggle yourself free during your turn by spending 8 Stamina, consuming your whole turn. A Frozen character can also be freed by taking any Fire-type damage or being set On Fire (cancelling both statuses). Mini-Bosses and Bosses are merely Slowed instead of being Frozen.

### **Halted**
While Halted, your Evasion is set to 0. You cannot move, or perform any Basic Attacks, Maneuvers, Techniques, or other actions that would cause you to move.

### **Hard to Hit**
While a foe is Hard to Hit, you suffer a -2 to all Rolls To-Hit and Accuracy checks against them, and your Spells and Techniques no longer automatically hit the foe (instead requiring a To-Hit check to land, including the penalty).

### **Hard to Hit, Extremely**
As Hard to Hit, but the penalty is now -5, instead of -2. This supersedes a foe being Hard to Hit. If you are Hard to Hit for multiple reasons, you may be Extremely Hard to Hit, at GM discretion.

### **Hasty**
Hasty increases your Movement by 1 per rank. 

### **Helplessness**
While Helpless, a creature cannot take any Standard, Movement, or Minor actions, cannot use Reactions, and they fall Prone. A Helpless creature’s Guard Stats are all set to 0. Helpless creatures are not harmed by any attack that does not target them and them alone, but if struck by an attack specifically targeted at them, they will die. Helplessness is cured by restoring any Health, though they will still have to stand up from being Prone on their own.

### **Invisibility**
While Invisible, enemies have difficulty targeting you, and effects based on sight do not trigger for you. However, you still cast a shadow, allowing perceptive foes to know your location. If a foe attacks you while they cannot see you (due to your Invisibility), treat them as if your foe was Blinded while trying to hit you. Typically, Invisibility ends once you are struck or you make an attack (at the attack’s end).

### **Knack**
Knacks are tied to specific Traits, or uses of Traits. When you do something you have a Knack for, you may choose to either:
- Roll twice, and use the better result; or,
- You may do it again, on another target within range, as part of the same action.

### **Mighty**
Increase your Combat & Willpower by 1 for each Rank of Mighty you have.

### **Off-Balance**
While Off-Balance, you cannot use Reactions, and you cannot use Evasion in place of Concentration or Vitality. You can still use Basic Attacks, Techniques, Spells, swap gear, move, and do other things. Unless the inflicting attack or effect says otherwise, Off-Balance ends at the beginning of your next turn. (You may use a Reaction against the attack that set you Off-Balance.)

### **Oil-Soaked**
While Oil-Soaked, you are extremely slippery, and extremely flammable. Being struck with any Fire damage will cause you to become On Fire (ending the status). You are immune to being Grappled or Soaked. If you were previously SandCovered, the sand is saturated (cancelling both the Oil-Soaked and Sand-Covered statuses). Oil-Soaked ends when you use Soap, or take an Extended Rest.

### **On Fire**
While you are On Fire, any wooden weapons that come into contact with you (including any you are holding, but not those stored in your pack) instantly begin Burning. While you are On Fire, you suffer 2 Fire damage per turn, taken at the start of your turn. This damage is not modified by your Defense, Vulnerability, or Resistance. You may stop being On Fire by entering water, taking Water-type damage, being Soaked (canceling both statuses), or by spending your full Movement action dropping to the ground and rolling in place (which makes you go Prone at the end of it).

### **Prone**
While Prone, you are flat on the ground. You cannot use Evasion against, and cannot be Hard to Hit with, Melee, Line, and “X targets within Y squares” attacks. However, you become Hard to Hit with all other attacks. It takes half of your Movement to stand up. While Prone, you cannot move around or make attacks, but you can still perform other actions. When a Mount is knocked prone, their rider is dismounted and knocked prone. If you are Slowed, you use all your Movement to stand up; if you are Halted, you cannot stand up from Prone.

### **Resistant**
Resistance always specifies the type of damage you are resistant to, such as “Shock” or “Piercing”. For each Rank of Resistant you have for that damage type, reduce the damage by 2 (before Defense and Reactions; minimum 1). If you are also Vulnerable to that damage type, you instead reduce the incoming damage by 1 per Rank. If an attack triggers multiple Resistances, apply only the highest Resistance.

### **Rusted**
While a weapon is Rusted, its Attack Power is reduced by 3, and all foes are Hard to Hit with that weapon. Only Metal weapons can become Rusted. Rust persists until the rust is removed by applying Oil.

### **Sand-Covered**
While Sand-Covered, all of your Guard Stats are reduced by 2. Further, you suffer a -2 to all Trait checks. If you were previously Oil-Soaked, the oil is absorbed (cancelling both the Oil-Soaked and Sand-Covered statuses). Being SandCovered also ends when you take a short or extended rest, when you are struck with a Water-element attack, when you are Soaked, or when you enter water.

### **Sick**
While Sick, every further action causes you pain. Whenever you perform a Standard Action, you suffer 2 damage afterwards. This damage can’t be reduced by Defense. While Sick, any Natural Weapons you wield have their Attack reduced by 3, and all foes are Hard to Hit with those Natural Weapons. Unless otherwise noted, Sickness persists until you restore any amount of Health (via magic, rest, or consuming a Dish or Elixir).

### **Slowed**
While Slowed, you find movement more difficult (but not impossible). Treat all terrain as Difficult Terrain – whether or not it would normally be, and whether or not you could normally walk through Difficult Terrain of that type without issue.

### **Soaked**
While Soaked, any Shock attacks that strike you turn into a Burst 1 that includes you. If this burst strikes other Soaked targets, they too inflict a Burst around themselves, and so on. (Any given creature will only take damage once from such an electric chain reaction, regardless.) Further, while Soaked, any Ice attacks that hit you will automatically inflict Frozen on you. If you were previously On Fire or your weapons were Burning, you and they are now extinguished (canceling both On Fire and Soaked). Soaked ends when you use a Towel, are struck with a Fire attack, are Frozen by an Ice attack, or take a Short or Extended Rest to dry off.

### **Tough**
Increase your Defense by 1 for each Rank of Tough you have.
