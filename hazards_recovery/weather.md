All Weathers go from Rank 0 (clear skies and temperate climate) to Rank 5 (absolute 
catastrophe). Every outdoor location has a given Weather type assigned to it. Rank 0 Weather always has no ill effects on Heroes. **Damage from Weather always ignores Defense.**

## Weather Checks

Whenever Heroes take a Short Rest, the GM should roll a 2d6 “Weather Check”. If the roll is equal to or greater than (7 + Weather’s current Rank), the weather gets one step more intense. If the weather is instead only equal to or greater than (4 + Weather’s current Rank), then it remains at the same intensity. If it’s lower than even that, then the weather decreases in intensity. When Heroes take an Extended Rest, the GM should perform this Weather Check three times, to simulate the weather changing over a long night.

Heroes, sages, or evil wizards skilled at performing Magical Songs may be able to use the *Wind’s Requiem* Song to bend the results of these Weather Checks – and thus, 
the weather itself – to their whim.

## Coldsnap

Coldsnaps are found in arctic climates, at high altitudes, or in the depths of winter.
- Your joints are chilled stiff. Your Evasion and Initiative are reduced by (Rank).
- At Rank 3, you risk frostbite. You take (Rank / 2) damage at the end of your turn in combat, or every 15 minutes out of combat. 
- At Rank 5, you risk freezing solid in the extreme cold. Whenever you take damage from the weather, roll Fortitude v. DC 15. If you fail, you are Frozen.

## Heatwave

Heatwaves are found in volcanoes, near underground magma floes, or simply in the dog days of summer.
- Sweat is in your eyes, and your body is weak from the heat. Your Concentration and Vitality are reduced by (Rank).
- At Rank 3, you risk heatstroke. You take (Rank / 2) damage at the end of your turn in combat, or every 15 minutes out of combat. All Bombs immediately explode upon exposure to air. Wooden weapons instantly begin Burning, and can only be extinguished by sheathing them or storing them in inventory.
- At Rank 5, you risk catching fire in the extreme heat. Whenever you take damage from the weather, roll Fortitude v. DC 15. If you fail, you catch On Fire.

## Rain

Rain is found in temperate climes, such as forests and plains, as well as beaches and on the high seas.
- While it is raining, fires are difficult, if not impossible, to light. Existing fires die out in (6 – Rank) turns unless covered or otherwise tended to.
- If you end your turn while climbing, roll an Athletics check v. DC (10 + Rank). If you fail, you slide down (Rank) squares.
- At Rank 2 or above, Brushfire terrain only deals 1 damage. Bombs are rendered inert, and Fire Arrows work like normal Arrows. Fire-type damage can still be dealt by Spells, Fire-enchanted weapons, or other innately fire-based attacks.
- At Rank 3 or above, lightning begins striking. At the end of every round, or every 15 minutes out of combat, the GM rolls a 2d6; on an 11 or higher, lightning strikes. Further, all targets are now Soaked as long as they are in the rain.
- At Rank 4 or above, the ground itself is too slippery to trust, and all surfaces are now Slightly Slick. In addition, all Brushfire terrain is immediately extinguished, and no new Brushfire terrain can be created. When the GM rolls to see if lightning strikes, it now strikes on a 10 or above.
- Finally, at Rank 5, the area is essentially flooded; treat all terrain as water-based Difficult Terrain. In addition, when the GM rolls to see if lightning strikes, it now strikes on a 9 or above.

> **When Lightning Strikes**
>
> Lightning preferentially targets anyone wielding metallic weapons, is at a higher elevation than other targets, or standing in water or is Soaked – in that order. If multiple targets satisfy one or more of these criteria, choose randomly from between only those qualifying targets with a die roll. If no targets qualify, then the lightning safely hits elsewhere.
>
> Being struck by lightning deals (2d6 x 1d6) Shock damage to whomever it strikes; this damage ignores any Defense (but not enchantments) provided by equipment.

## Sandstorm

Standstorms are found in deserts, arid locations, or desolate, forgotten wastelands.

- In a Sandstorm, harsh, changing winds make it difficult to line up shots. Reduce the range of Projectile attacks by (Rank), and the range of Blast, Burst, and Cone attacks by (Rank / 2), minimum 1.
- At Rank 2, sand begins to obscure one’s vision. All foes are now Hard to Hit.
- At Rank 3, the sand has gotten everywhere. You are now Sand-Covered for as long as you are in the sandstorm.
- At Rank 4, the whipping winds make practiced maneuvers difficult to perform. All foes are now Extremely Hard to Hit.
- At Rank 5, the wind is too powerful and noisy to be heard over, no matter how loudly you shout. Further, visibility is so low that hand signals are impossible to make out. Heroes (and their players) cannot communicate with one another in any way.
