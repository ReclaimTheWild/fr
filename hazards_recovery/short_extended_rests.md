Between battles and adventures, Heroes need to rest! They may take Short or Extended Rests to recuperate.

**Short Rests** range from five minutes to an hour, but are typically around half an hour. During a Short Rest, Heroes can eat a Dish to restore their Health, Stamina, or Magic, but do not have enough time to sleep to restore their resources naturally. Short Rests are typically just the Heroes taking a moment to rest, eat a meal, chit-chat between one another, or just stretch their muscles, before setting out on adventure again.

**Extended Rests** range from four hours to an entire day, typically lasting about 8 hours. During an Extended Rest, Heroes can eat a Dish to restore their Health, Stamina, or Magic, but can also sleep to restore their resources further. Extended Rests are typically the Heroes bedding down for the night, or taking a day off to take care of errands or visit with NPC friends.

In both Short and Extended Rests, Heroes may take the time to craft, as their Materials, available Tools, and circumstances allow. If the Heroes are resting in a town or other settlement, they may use the services there to their fullest while resting – IE, they may use the town’s Forge and peruse the shops, even if they are rooming at the town’s Inn.

During either Short or Extended Rests, if the Heroes are resting in a place that has obvious scavenging opportunities, they may also scavenge for materials – for instance, if the Heroes are resting in a field of flowers, then they may scavenge those flowers. However, they may not venture far from camp to scavenge (at that point, you’re simply adventuring again).

Short Rests only allow enough time for a single attempt to scavenge materials, while Extended Rests (particularly those not spent sleeping) may allow for more attempts.

## Keeping Watch

If resting in a dangerous place, such as in the middle of a dungeon, you may want to have someone keep watch!

While on watch, a Hero may consume a Dish, and idly chat with their fellows (if they are nearby), but may not spend their time doing anything else productive (such as crafting, scavenging, deconstructing, investigating the area, or performing magical Songs).

During an Extended Rest, Heroes typically take turns keeping watch, giving everyone ample time for sleep, crafting, scavenging, and other activities – however, threats may approach at different times during the Extended Rest, so it may matter who was on watch and when.

## Rest & Relaxation

Health, Magic, and Stamina can be recovered by taking an Extended Rest, even without the benefit of consuming Dishes.

**Resting in arduous conditions** (such as in bad Weather) will not restore any Health, Magic, or Stamina. You may still consume Dishes to recover, though.

**Resting outdoors without a bedroll** (but in otherwise decent weather) recovers 25% of your Health, as well as 25% of your Burned Magic and Burned Stamina.

**Resting outdoors, in a bedroll**, recovers 50% of your Health, Burned Magic, and Burned Stamina. (Using high-quality bedrolls will offer the benefit of extra Temporary HP.)

**Resting in a real bed**, safely indoors, fully restores all your Health, Magic, and Stamina.

**Resting in luxurious circumstances**, such as an extra-soft bed, not only recovers all of your Health, Magic, and Stamina, but also provides Temporary Health. By default, this is just one Heart’s worth (4 HP), but the more luxurious (and expensive) the accommodations, the more Temporary Health you might gain. Different kinds of luxurious conditions may provide Temporary MP or SP, or other unique benefits, instead.

The above only applies if you are safe, dry, and at a comfortable temperature. If you are not in such an environment – for instance, if you are resting in soaking rain – then the rest you receive is one step less effective.

For instance, resting in a simple, proper bed, but while exposed to an uncomfortable Heatwave, will recover only 50% of your Health, rather than all of it.

So long as you are not resting in arduous circumstances, you’ll always recover at least 1 Health, Magic, and Stamina.

## Consuming Food while Resting

Health, Stamina, and Magic can be restored by consuming food during Short or Extended Rests. A Hero can only consume a single Dish in a given Short or Extended Rest, and food can only be eaten during a rest, so choose your rations wisely.

Any other benefits Dishes or Elixirs might have, such as boosting your Perception or making you resistant to cold weather, will always end at the end of the next Extended Rest, when their duration runs out, or when you consume some other Dish or Elixir with a special benefit – whichever occurs first.

When consuming a Dish or Elixir with a special effect during a Rest, Heroes may choose whether the duration of the Dishes or Elixirs they consume begins at the beginning, or the end, of the Short or Extended Rest.

Having the duration begin at the start of the Rest allows the effects to be useful while the Hero runs errands during the Rest, but having the duration begin at the end of the Rest gives the consumed delicacy the most time to be useful while on adventure. Regardless, the Hero may still only consume one Dish per Rest, whether they do so at the start of the end of the Rest.

A Hero may only be under the effect of one Food benefit and one Elixir benefit at a time. Consuming a new Food or Elixir while still under an old Food or Elixir’s effects will simply end the old consumable’s effects.
