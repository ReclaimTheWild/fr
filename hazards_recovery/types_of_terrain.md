### **Brush, Thick**
Difficult Terrain. Turns into Brushfire when struck with a Fire attack, or if adjacent to something else that is On Fire (such as Brushfire terrain) at the end of a round of combat or every five minutes.

### **Brushfire**
Terrain that is currently on fire. Deals 2 Fire damage when stepping into it or starting one’s turn in it, ignoring Defense. Will light one On Fire if one spends an entire turn (start to finish) in Brushfire. While burning, casts Dim Light in a Burst 1, and creates an Updraft. Ceases burning after 5 minutes, turning into normal terrain.

### **Electrified**
Deals 2 Shock damage, and sets one Off-Balance, when stepping into it or starting one’s turn in it, ignoring Defense. Grass, Tall: Normal terrain (does not impede or hinder movement). Large swaths of tall grass are good places to hide, or scavenge for Critters. As flammable as Thick Brush.

### **Ice, Dry**
Slightly Slick surface.

### **Ice, Slick**
Severely Slick surface.

### **Lava**
Lava is a liquid, and thus can be swum in – with disastrous consequences for most Heroes. Lava deals 4 Fire damage, and sets you On Fire, when stepping into it or starting one’s turn in it, ignoring Defense. 

### **Malice**
Deadly terrain suffused with evil. Deals 4 damage, and makes you Sick, when stepping into it or starting one’s turn in it, ignoring Defense.

### **Mire**
Viscous swamp-water. May be kneedeep (letting you to trudge through it) or deeper (requiring swimming). Difficult Terrain. Deals 2 damage when stepping into it or starting one’s turn in it, ignoring Defense.

### **Oiled**
A Severely Slick surface. When you fall Prone, if all spaces you occupy are Oiled, then you become Oil-Soaked. If the oil is on the surface of water, you are Oil-Soaked only so long as you occupy those squares.

If an Oil-Soaked square is intentionally struck with a Fire attack, exposed to excessive heat or errant sparks, or is adjacent to Brushfire at the start of the round, it becomes Brushfire.

### **Pit, Bottomless**
Bottomless Pits are weird and dangerous. If you fall into a Bottomless Pit, you disappear. You reappear at the start of your next turn, at the edge of the battlefield or the entrance of the room. You then take 4 damage, ignoring Defense.

### **Sand, Deep**
Difficult Terrain.

### **Sand, Quick**
Difficult Terrain. If a creature spends a full turn on Quicksand, they sink to their hips and become Halted and SandCovered, and must spend a Standard Action to dig themselves out (ending the Halted status, but not the Sand-Covered status).

### **Slick, Severely**
When moving horizontally on a Severely Slick surface, you must make an Agility roll v. DC 16 to stop. If you fail, on an odd-numbered roll, you continue to move in the direction you were travelling until you bump into something (like a creature or solid object) or leave the Severely Slick surface; on an even-numbered roll, you fall Prone.

When moving vertically on a Severely Slick surface (such as climbing), make the roll using Athletics. On a failed odd roll, you slide back down until you bump into something; on a failed even roll, you lose your grip and fall.

### **Slick, Slightly**
When moving horizontally on a Slightly Slick surface, you must make an Agility roll v. DC 10 to stop. If you fail, on an odd-numbered roll, you will continue to move one further square in the direction you were travelling; on an even-numbered roll, you become Off-Balance.

When moving vertically on a Slightly Slick surface (such as climbing), make the roll using Athletics. On a failed odd roll, you slide back down one square; on a failed even roll, you become Off-Balance.

### **Snow, Deep**
Difficult Terrain.

### **Water, Current**
Currents in water can carry swimmers along, whether they like it or not. When you enter or start your turn in a current, you are immediately pulled along by it. Weak currents will only pull you 2 squares; a strong current will pull up to 6 squares; a torrential current, up to 10.

### **Water**
When you enter water (whether Foaming, Fresh, or Salt), you become Soaked. This Soaked status can’t be removed until you exit the water.

### **Water, Foaming**
Difficult Terrain. Dazzles anyone while they are in the foam.

### **Water, Fresh**
Freshwater, including most streams and lakes, can have negative consequences for metallic equipment. While swimming in freshwater, whenever metal weapons take Durability damage (including at the end of combat), roll (2d6+Rank) – on a roll of 10 or less, the item is Rusted.

### **Water, Salt**
Saltwater, including ocean water, has disastrous effects on metallic items. While in saltwater, whenever metal weapons take Durability damage (including at the end of combat), they automatically become Rusted.
