    "content": "Each round of Combat, you have four types of actions: Standard, Move, Minor, and Reactions. Standard actions are the most important and impactful: Basic Attacks, most Maneuvers, and most Spells and Techniques, are Standard actions, unless otherwise noted. You can only perform a single Standard action per turn. You may use your Standard to instead perform a Minor action. Minor actions are smaller, but still useful: Swapping inventory, some Spells and Techniques, or using an item are all Minor actions. You can perform a single Minor action per turn, though you can choose to use a Standard action to perform a Minor action instead. Move actions are simply when your character moves. While you can move multiple times in a single turn, you have limited pool of Movement points (usually 6), regardless of what method of travel you use (walking, swimming, flying, etc.). You can spend that Movement across multiple Move actions during your turn. Reactions are things that you perform while it’s not your turn – typically, actions that help mitigate incoming attacks. You can perform an unlimited number of Reactions per round of combat, but you can only perform any given Reaction once per round. Your Reactions refresh at the beginning of your turn. There are also Free actions, which are simply things that don’t consume any other action type. These tend to be very small and quick actions, such as drawing or sheathing a weapon, or speaking aloud. You can perform an infinite number of Free actions during your turn – or at least, as many as the GM’s patience will allow. ",

Bombs may be placed at one’s feet, thrown like any one-handed weapon, or you may pull them out, light the fuse, and hold on to them until you decide to place or throw them later (or allow them to explode in your hand). A Bomb’s fuse can be lit without additional tools, as a free action. Bombs explode at the end of the user’s next turn, unless otherwise stated. A Bomb may be held in one’s hand while lit and ticking down. Bombs can be detonated early by striking them with any Fire or Electric attack, or another Bomb’s explosion. If struck with a Water element attack, a Bomb is harmlessly rendered inert, and is able to be relit. Any other attack safely destroys the bomb without detonating it. Bombs have 10 Evasion, and no Concentration or Vitality. When thrown (such as down a monster’s throat), Bombs have a Weapon Accuracy of 3. Bombs are one-handed, unless otherwise noted; thus, throwing one is a “Throw 1H” Basic Attack. If thrown on the turn it would explode, a Bomb will detonate upon impact. Bombs can’t be used as part of Techniques. When rolling To-Hit for additional effects, Bombs do not use their wielder’s Accuracy, but have their own Accuracy Trait of 5. This means their total To-Hit bonus is +8. Bombs do not need to roll To-Hit to inflict damage, only for their additional effects (if any). Damage from Bombs ignores Defense. All types of Bombs deal 8 Blunt-type damage in a Burst 1 (including their own square) when they detonate, unless otherwise noted. Bombs hurt both friends and foes. When they detonate, they affect everyone in range. If many Bombs’ explosions are chained together, a creature is only hurt by the Bomb that would most damage them.

    "title": "Applying Passives",
    "content": "One of the most powerful and versatile ways to make a Monster a unique, interesting, and thematically appropriate threat is through Passive abilities. Passive abilities are special properties of a Monster that are always in play, similar to Feats for Heroes. Monsters don’t need to spend time activating Passives, and may not even need to be conscious for them to cause Heroes problems. If an effect requires the Monster to take an action to activate, it’s better off as a custom Spell or Technique. Most Passives only work in certain circumstances – for instance, when someone touches the Monster, while it’s trying to hide, or when it’s shrouded in darkness. This allows the Monster to be very good (or very bad) at a skill in a particular circumstance, or for it to have innate effects that are otherwise impossible to replicate with existing Traits and Feats. Passives should work to make a Monster better fit its theme, or to better fulfill its Role. Passives should not be used as a way to simply boost a Monster’s destructive power. For example, a Passive that causes a Monster to Distract all foes adjacent to it is a great way to reinforce its Role as a Protector, while a Passive that causes anyone who touches a Monster to catch On Fire helps reinforce that this creature is wreathed in flames. Because Passives can cover a wide range of potential effects, require broad or narrow circumstances, and are otherwise difficult to quantify, GMs are advised to limit Monsters to possessing only about 3 Passive abilities –but remember that ‘more’ is not always ‘more fun’, just ‘more complicated’.

These rules are not intended for every game – rather, they’re intended to be used only after the GM and the players have discussed the additional rules, and their ramifications. By default, games run in Reclaim the Wild do NOT use Assist Mode rules. Assist Mode rules can be applied to a game as a whole, or the GM may choose to use some rules, and discard others.

    "content": "When you attack a foe using a weapon, you will be asked to “Roll To-Hit”. A roll To-Hit is 2d6 + Accuracy + Weapon Bonus. Rolls To-Hit do not exist in a vacuum, though – they must then be compared to the target’s Concentration, Evasion, or Vitality, as specified by the attack’s text. (Evasion may be used in place of Concentration or Vitality, unless the defender is Off-Balance.) . If your To-Hit roll equals or exceeds the opponent’s score, then the attack or effect hits; otherwise, it misses. A missed attack acts essentially as if it never happened – no damage is dealt, no durability is lost, no effects are enacted upon the target or the user. (If the attack cost Magic or Stamina, however, then that cost is still spent.) If an attack’s Effect misses, then the attack still deals damage, but does not inflict that additional effect. If you roll a 12 on your 2d6 when rolling To-Hit with a Basic Attack, it is a Critical Hit. (See the Critical Hits section for more information.) There are enchantments that can increase this range – if you have a +1 to your Critical Hit range, then a roll of 11 or 12 on your 2d6 would be a Critical Hit. Spells and Techniques automatically hit, except when other circumstances say otherwise (such as being Distracted or Blinded). Spells and Techniques can still be mitigated by Reactions. When a Spell or Technique hits a foe, it may have additional effects that can occur if you succeed at a roll To-Hit, against the foe’s Concentration or Vitality (noted in the Spell or Technique’s Effect section). These checks only decide if the additional effect occurs; failing this check does not change whether or not the target suffers damage from the Spell or Technique. If the Spell or Technique misses for any reason, then you do not even roll to see if any additional effects land – they, too, miss. Spells and Techniques are never made Critical Hits due to rolls To-Hit, although other circumstances can make a Spell or Technique be a Critical Hit. Note that, for unarmed attacks, you have a Weapon Accuracy bonus of 5 – but no damage bonus from an equipped weapon (as you don’t have one!). If an Attack targets multiple foes, you must roll all To-Hit checks once for each foe. This applies for Basic Attacks, as well as Spells and Techniques that require To-Hit checks. ",

    "content": "In some campaigns, you might decide to forego mapping out the battlefield, and simply describe it – how it looks, where combatants are standing, and the terrain that surrounds them. In these cases, the Attack Ranges above change to accommodate the nature of Abstract Combat! . Burst: Hits 2 targets for every 1 in the Range. For instance, a Burst 1 can hit up to 2 foes, and a Burst 2 can hit up to 4 foes. May hit 1 additional foe if all targeted foes are described as being close together (standing within arm’s reach of one another). Blast, Cone, Line, or Sweep: Hits 1 target, plus 1 additional target for every 2 in the Range beyond the first. For instance, a Cone 2 would hit just one foe, but a Cone 3 hits 2 foes. May hit 1 additional foe if all targeted foes are described as being close together (standing within arm’s reach of one another). Melee, Projectile: Hit 1 foe. X Targets/Squares within Y Squares: Can hit X targets, if the user can identify their foe’s locations accurately. In addition, some foes might not be able to be hit alongside other foes, no matter the attack’s range. For instance, if a foe is up on a balcony, hiding behind cover, or if they’ve specifically separated themselves from the other foes, then they cannot be included in an attack with other foes. Even moreso than in other situations, when it comes to Abstract Combat, the GM’s word is law! However, GMs are encouraged to allow players to include a tricky foe in a large-area attack if the player is able to come up with a clever, fun, or unique way to go about it. ",

Multiply your Combat by 2, then add your Weapon’s Attack Power of 5, for a total of 11 damage. Once the damage output is calculated, subtract the target’s Defense. Then, apply the target’s Resistance to the attack, if any. Finally, apply any other factors. This final result is how much Health the target loses.

Typically, foes will then turn to fight the remaining Heroes, leaving the Helpless Hero alone. While Helpless, a creature may still be blearily aware of their surroundings, but can take no actions, have no Guard Stats, and cannot move. At best, they can croak out a call for aid. Restoring any Health to a Helpless creature ends their Helpless state, though they may still need to stand up from being Knocked Prone. Creatures that are Helpless (rather than merely sleeping or unaware) can be killed, but it must be done with an attack specifically directed at them, and only them. A Helpless foe will not be further harmed by an AoE that merely happens to catch them in the blast while hitting other targets. The attack can be of any suitable type or range, but it must target that Helpless creature, and only that Helpless creature. Even Heroes can be finished off while Helpless by a follow-up attack.

Ever-Ready now explicitly references Belt Slots. | Here: The Twili bonus that grants two additional items on the hips now explicitly references Belt Slots. This change includes a preemptive clarification that items in those Slots are not hidden when In-Hand. | Here: Removed Hand Slots and replaced them with two additional Belt Slots, as well as the In-Hand condition. This is intended to allow a Hero to hold up to 4 items, regardless of whether they are 1H or 2H items, without otherwise changing how sheathing and holding items work. | Here &amp; Here: Clarified that Maneuvers are Standard Actions unless otherwise stated. | Here: Clarified that Pickpocket takes an entire stack of items on a success. | Here: Clarified that, while Halted, you can’t do other things that would move you (such as Maneuvers or Techniques). | Here: Fairy Friend: an enemy can now be Marked by multiple fairies, but the To-Hit bonus cannot stack if you do so. This will allow everyone to benefit from Fairy Friend Focus in a battle with only one enemy. | Here: Doppelganger’s Movement now costs 8 Stamina, not 10. | Here: Perfect Deflection no longer references “your Shield” in its Effect text; it instead refers to your Defensive Weapon. In addition, it now references the attacker’s Concentration instead of “the target’s”. | Here: Daruk’s Protection has been reworked: it now guarantees a 50% reduction against all types of attacks, but on a successful To-Hit it will completely negate the attack’s damage and other negative effects. | Here &amp; Here: For the Silvered enchantment and Silver Arrows, linked the “Ancient &amp; Irredeemable Evil” section to help point people toward an idea of a “great evil”. Also made minor grammatical fixes. | Here: Capitalized an instance of “Ingredient”. | Here: Added a section detailing the Point Value of bought Dishes/Elixirs in the top table, as well as a reminder to check the appropriate section to determine what benefits the Dishes/Elixirs provide. | Here: Bedrolls no longer contradict the Rest &amp; Relaxation rules on page 75, as their entry now points to that section for their main benefit. | Here: The Master Cycle now gains (Rank +1) Durability from most Materials, with Ancient Materials restoring ((Rank+1) x 4) Durability. This will allow rank 0 Materials to be useful. | Here: Added text to the Weapon Spirit that clarifies that it can have two of the same Weapon Enchantment. Much like with Armor and Food Enchantments, their Ranks stack up to their regular maximum of 5. | Here: Upgrading a Natural Weapon now uses your base Traits, as intended. | Here: Added in text reminding people to keep track of partial Tokens for their Companions. Also some mild wording changes elsewhere. | Here: The wording of the Repair Anything Assist Mode has been slightly changed to match its intended tone. | Here: Added in a new Master Mode that allows Companions to gain Tokens when Heroes do, instead of when Heroes spend their Tokens. | .

    "title": "Determine Concept",
    "content": "The first step is also the most important: What kind of character do you want to play? . Typically, a character’s concept can be summed up in a quick, broad description: just a few words, or a sentence or two, at most. For instance, you might want to play “a fast-talking knight,” “a romantic herbalist”, or “a wizard who seeks acceptance.” . This concept helps determine what Traits, Feats, Techniques, and Spells you might want to purchase for your character. A “cunning warrior” likely wants to have a high Combat Trait, and strong interpersonal Traits like Guile and Influence, but might choose to ignore Willpower, Mechanics, or Nature. Typically, most characters start as aspiring Heroes, just on the cusp of beginning to build their legend and make their mark on the world. This means that they are not yet storied, seasoned adventurers! Your character concept should leave plenty of room to grow into greatness. You may want to consider what Race your character is at this stage, but it isn’t required. “An aspiring songstress” could be of any Race, for instance; you might decide to simply choose whichever Race catches your fancy, or one that has a statistical advantage for you. Don’t worry too much about the other personal details at this stage. Things like the character’s name, age, and appearance will come at the end of the character creation process, as part of the Finishing Touches. Concept Pitfalls . In any tabletop game, it’s important to have a character that can work well with both the rest of the group, and with the GM’s intended setting and tone. When you come up with your character concept, you should think about how your character will interact with the other players and their characters, as well as how they’ll fit with the campaign’s tone! . Here, we’ve listed three common pitfalls that character concepts can fall into. If your character falls into one of these categories, you should talk to your GM, and see what you can do to help flesh them out, and to ensure that you (and the other players!) can still have fun with the game – or, you may want to consider working with a different character concept. Lone Wolves might be a problem, because they’ll be more likely to split the GM’s attention when they go their own way, and less likely to want to participate in the events going on with the rest of the party. This can lead to the Lone Wolf’s player becoming bored and disconnected from events, and other characters simply forgetting about them entirely. If you want to play a loner character, be sure they have a reason to stick with the party, even when your character might prefer to be alone. “Evil” characters might cause issue, simply because they’re going to do bad things that the other party members might object to – leading to the party fighting amongst themselves more often than they fight actual monsters. You can absolutely play characters with different sets of morals, and your character may have failings or even occasionally do mean things. However, we highly recommend you don’t try to be a bad guy in a group of do-gooders – nobody wants the fight of good against evil to come to blows around the gaming table. Incongruent characters are those that just don’t fit the game or its world. A disillusioned veteran of a bloody war, for instance, might not fit into a world of simple “good vs. evil” morality straight out of a cartoon show. Conversely, an innocent, wide-eyed squire who believes in the power of friendship might not make sense in a world under the despotic thumb of an evil overlord. When these characters enter play, they often find that they just can’t handle the world as it was made; at best, they either adjust quickly (the innocent squire learning many harsh lessons very quickly); at worst, they may be shunned by the other characters in the group. When coming up with your character concept, don’t be afraid to talk to the GM, and ask “would my character make sense in your world?” . ",

    "content": "The next decision in creating a character is also one of the simplest: what race are they? . A Hero’s race helps determine how they look, where they came from, and the kind of life they lived before they began their adventure. It also helps determine some of the things they are more naturally inclined towards; for instance, Gerudo are often skilled warriors, while Sheikah are more likely to know forgotten lore. The Primary Races – Gerudo, Goron, Hylian, Rito, Sheikah, and Zora – are the most likely to be acceptable choices in your game world. These are the most common races in Hyrule, as seen in Breath of the Wild, and the most likely to go on a wide-ranging adventure. The Secondary Races – Deku, Demon, Fairy, Subrosian, Talking Animal, and Twili – may or may not be available in your game world; be sure to consult with your GM before selecting one of these races for your character. You can read more about the various races in Reclaim the Wild – who they are, what they represent, and what they’re skilled at – in the Races chapter. ",

    "title": "Purchasing Traits",
    "content": "Your Traits describe your character’s skills and prowess. All Traits start at 1 for free. As an adventurer, burgeoning Hero, or a legend yet untold, you have 80 Tokens of Heroism to spend across all 24 Traits, and can bring any Trait up to a maximum of 5. This pool of Tokens can only be spent on Traits. This maximum is just at character creation; once you’re past that, you can go above that original maximum of 5. You may spend Tokens of Heroism to increase a Trait by a single point. The cost is always equal to the number that the Trait will be rising to – for instance, if you wish to increase your Arcana Trait from 4 to 5, that costs 5 Tokens. All Traits max out at 10 – a person’s body simply cannot contain more skill than that naturally, though the use of food, elixirs or equipment can increase it further. See the Character Traits chapter for more information on Traits and what they do. Trait Quick Purchase . Rather than buying your Traits one by one, you can instead use a Quick Purchase array. All of these arrays use all 80 Tokens exactly – just choose which Traits get which numbers! . “Varied” – Three Traits at 4, seven Traits at 3, nine Traits at 2, and five Traits at 1. “Jack of All Trades” – Two Traits at 4, six Traits at 3, sixteen Traits at 2. “Ready to Learn” – Twelve Traits at 3, ten Traits at 2, two Traits at 1. “Strength without Weakness” – One Trait at 5, two Traits at 4, two Traits at 3, and nineteen Traits at 2. “Focused on Their Strengths” – Three Traits at 5, two Traits at 4, two Traits at 3, five Traits at 2, and twelve Traits at 1. “Talented but Troublesome” – Six Traits at 4, two Traits at 3, eight Traits at 2, and eight Traits at 1. Health, Stamina, and Magic Most Heroes should put some Tokens towards Health, and at least one of either Stamina or Magic. Even if you’re aiming for a “glass cannon” character, it’s strongly recommended to put at least a few Tokens towards your Health! After all, nobody’s going to sing the praises of a Hero who fainted in pain after stubbing their toe on a table leg. That Last Remaining Point . If you purchase Traits without using a Quick Purchase array, you may end up with a few Tokens that you simply can’t find a good place for. If you find yourself in that situation, there’s a simple trick that might help you use up those last few Tokens: . | Find two Traits that currently have the same score: two 2’s, two 3’s, or two 4’s. | Subtract a point from one of those two Traits, gaining back the Tokens. | Increase the other Trait by 1, spending the Tokens you got back in the previous step, plus one. You now have exactly one less Token than you had before! | . With this technique, you should be able to spend every last Token you have available for Traits at character creation. However, if you just can’t find any place that feels appropriate for your character’s Tokens to go, speak with your GM – with their permission, you can simply hang on to the Tokens left over, and spend them later, when you’ve acquired a few more. GMs should be careful, though, as this could be used as a long-term way to minmax in the hands of a less scrupulous player. Secondary Stats . Once you’ve determined your Traits, you’ll need to fill in your secondary stats. This includes your Health, Stamina, and Magic, how well you resist negative effects, how far you can Jump, and how much you can Lift. See the Secondary Stats section in the next Chapter for more information on how to fill in these numbers. Movement Types . All Heroes begin play able to walk and swim. They are Natural Walkers, meaning that they can move 6 squares on foot in a single round of combat. All Heroes are also (non-Natural) Climbers and Swimmers, enabling them to tread water or clamber up cliffs, but moving half as quickly as they would on land. Depending on your Race, you may be able to swim better than most, or even fly in the air! Be sure to note these movement types down. See the Movement section for more info. ",

    "title": "Determine Finishing Touches",
    "content": "Once you know all the numbers that your character has, it’s time to put the finishing touches on them – the Finishing Touches. While we’re presenting the Finishing Touches in order of least to most complicated, it should be noted that they can be tackled in any order – and often, one detail will affect another! If you ever feel stuck on one Finishing Touch, then move on to another; inspiration might just strike while you’re there. Name, Age, and Appearance . All Heroes have a name, an age, and an appearance. Many Heroes also have an affect, as well. A Hero’s Name is often influenced by their Race, their origins, and their lineage. A prince fleeing his kingdom might have a long, ornate name, with titles and descriptors; a boy born in the wild and raised by Moblins might only have two different grunts strung together to form his name. A good name can go a long way to establishing a Hero’s character. We recommend evocative names, ones that you don’t hear very often in your own day-to-day life; it helps the Hero seem more powerful, interesting, and unique! . Age and Appearance go hand-in-hand. Think about how you’d describe your Hero’s appearance to someone who was waiting for them to arrive for a meeting, but had never met them before. What color are your character’s eyes and hair? How tall are they? How old are they? Do they have any scars from previous battles, or markings or tattoos that indicate past affiliations? Do they always wear a certain accessory, like an earring or an eyepatch? All of these details can help your Hero stand out from the crowd. While thinking about your character’s Appearance, you may also want to consider their Affect – how they speak, move, and act. A unique turn of phrase, an accent, or a habitual fidget they indulge in, can all help flesh out your character, making them more memorable (and more fun to play, too!). Personality . Heroes don’t just venture into the wilderness, fighting monsters and gathering treasure, on a whim. They also aren’t just sentient spreadsheets of combat statistics, either. Heroes have Personalities, Goals, and sometimes, Ties. A Hero’s Personality helps define how they act in the moment – if you ever aren’t sure what your Hero might do when presented with a given situation, you can fall back on their Personality as a guide. This can be a simple descriptor, like “bold” or “neurotic”, or it can be more complex guidelines for how your character acts when presented with certain things, like “always runs in head-first to help the helpless” or “prefers to steal from criminals, rather than turn them in”. Goals . A Hero’s Goals, of course, are what motivates them. Why did your character decide to leave whatever comfort and safety they had, to risk life and limb in the wild? This might be as simple as “it’s the right thing to do” or “if I don’t, the world will end”, but even when faced with an existential threat, Heroes will want to accomplish other goals along the way. They may want to keep their particular hometown safe and prosperous, make sure a tragic event in their past doesn’t happen to anyone else, start a business, find their family, fall in love, uncover ancient secrets, or become the world’s most powerful warrior. When defining your character’s Goals, try to include a mix of short-term and long-term goals. The short-term goals are things that you can accomplish relatively quickly – anywhere from one session to a handful of sessions of play – and will probably be replaced with new short-term goals as you complete them. Longer-term goals take far longer to complete, generally covering the length of the campaign; they may requiring traveling all over the world, collecting a large number of things or money, or an internal struggle that will take more than a few therapeutic chats around the campfire to resolve. Both short- and long-term goals should help make explicit what things your character thinks are important to them. Whatever your Hero’s Goals, the GM (and the other players!) can use them as something to help drive your adventure and keep your character motivated. Ties . While many a campaign has started with a handful of strangers meeting in a bar and deciding, on a whim, to put their lives in one another’s hands, that may not be the case for your character and their adventuring party-to\u0002be. Groups with members that have pre-existing Ties to one another are more likely to stick together, and have more opportunities to roleplay with one another. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the Heroes are already best friends, or even that they know one another at all – but a Tie to another character means that, before the adventure begins, there’s some reason that the two characters might meet up and interact, as more than just strangers. They could be childhood friends who grew apart, ex-rivals for their mutual first crush’s affections, have once been on opposite sides of a battle, or simply be from the same town. Ties are not required – and depending on the game your GM wants to run, they may not exist at all – but they can definitely be useful, especially during the early sessions as you work out how your character interacts with the other players’ characters. They also help solve the question of, “why would my character work with these people?” . If you aren’t sure what Ties you want your Hero to have to the other players’ Heroes, you might choose to randomly roll one. (GMs might also want to use this to relate NPCs to one another, or to the Heroes!) Simply roll two six-sided dice (“2d6”); one die represents the section, and the other decides the entry within the section, in the table below. If you get an entry you don’t like or can’t use, don’t worry – you can switch your dice around, reroll, or interpret the result “creatively!” The point of this table is to get inspired and excited, not to create a hard-and-fast ruling. | Bonds of Love     i. Is a sibling of     ii. Is a cousing or distant relative of     iii. Rivals for another’s affection with     iv. Pursued by the same paramour as     v. Adopted into the same family as     vi.

Members of the same tradesman guild | . Backstory . Heroes don’t just pop into existence, fully formed – they come from somewhere, having lived a life before they began their adventure. A character’s history can inform how they speak, how they act, how they dress, and their outlook on life. There are many ways to write a Backstory: some players like to write them as actual short stories, with a beginning, middle, and a “to be continued” finale that leads into the events of the game. Others prefer to simply list broad strokes of biographical detail: place of birth, school, the job they had before adventuring. However you want to do it, we encourage you to use your Backstory as an opportunity to learn more about your character! . Backstory is the Finishing Touch that most heavily relies on the game’s setting and world, because your character has been living in that world for all of their life before beginning their adventure. Don’t be afraid to discuss your character’s Backstory with your GM! Working together, you might both discover interesting details – things that the GM can use to come up with new details about their world, or new adventure ideas that cater to your character. ",

    "title": "Earning Tokens of Heroism",
    "content": "Heroes earn Tokens of Heroism from performing heroic deeds. As Heroes, they should strive to tame the wild, encourage unity and peace between different groups, improve the lot of the common populace, and end threats to small villages, large cities, or the entire world. Slaying monsters wantonly is not, in-and-of itself, heroic – merely bloodthirsty. Rather, Heroes should seek foes, tasks, and quests that add to their legend, that challenge them, and that force them to grow – not only as warriors, but as symbols of civilization and the better angels of our nature. Typically, Heroes should earn one Token each when they complete some small task or mission: defending a group of passers-by from a sudden monster ambush, defeating a worthy foe in a fair match, or helping out a villager with their strenuous day-to-day work. Heroes might also earn a Token for solving a puzzle, clearing a portion of a dungeon, or otherwise advancing their goals a solid step. They might also earn a Token for having a deep conversation with an ally, learning an important piece of lore, or for coming up with a unique solution to a problem. They may also find single Tokens of Heroism in places that reward exploration, such as within treasure chests, hidden in hidey-holes about the land, or for solving ancient puzzles and riddles. (Of course, Heroes only earn that Tokens of Heroism if the task was challenging – nothing comes for free.) . Of course, Heroes might earn a single Token of Heroism simply for good roleplay, cool moments, making everyone laugh, or just having fun. Heroes typically earn 2 Tokens of Heroism for completing small quests or a short string of challenges: rescuing a lost child from a Moblin camp, finding multiple herbs that an alchemist needed to cure their sick spouse, or exploring a trapped bandit cave, would all serve as examples. Heroes typically earn 4 Tokens of Heroism for completing major quests: defeating the dreaded guardian of a sprawling ancient tomb, foiling a villain’s master plan to take over a city, defending a keep through the entirety of a week-long onslaught of foes. Often, these adventures are capped off by defeating a massively powerful foe – a worthy notch in any Hero’s belt. These adventures might also feature moments where Heroes have accomplished other, lesser feats along the way, earning Tokens all the while. For truly epic finales, wherein Heroes defeat the root of a number of evils, save entire kingdoms, or defend the entirety of existence from threats beyond the understanding of mortal beings, awards of even more Tokens might be called for. Such instances will likely be rare, happening no more than once or twice in a full campaign. GMs might award Tokens of Heroism immediately, when Heroes do the heroic actions or find legend-enhancing treasures; or, they may award them by fiat, at the end of a session of play. Some GMs may use both of these methods, as suits their style or the situation. Whenever Tokens of Heroism are awarded, each Hero at the table should obtain the same amount – they are not split or shared. As a rough guideline, GMs should expect to award 2-4 Tokens per session of gameplay. More laid-back sessions might earn fewer, and more industrious players might garner more; but when in doubt, “about three” is a good number of Tokens to give your players for an evening of enjoyable adventure.

Raising a Trait costs a number of Tokens equal to the number the Trait is rising to. For instance, raising your Combat from 4 to 5 costs 5 Tokens. Feats, Spells, and Techniques cost their listed amount. You must meet their Requirements (without the aid of Food, Elixirs, Enchantments, or anything else) in order to be able to purchase them. Tokens of Heroism may be spent during any Short or Extended Rest. You may also save them up for as long as you like – Tokens never expire, and there is no limit to how many Tokens you may have. Spending a Token of Heroism is simply an expression. If you received a Bokoblin-tooth necklace as a Token of Heroism, and you spend the Token to improve your character, you do not lose possession of the necklace – you may still wear it, show it to others, or even give it to someone else. The necklace simply holds no more power, and cannot advance your legend (or your power) any further. Likewise, if you give that Bokoblin-tooth necklace away, or even destroy it, before spending the Token of Heroism, you do not lose the Token. Once a Token is received, it is yours no matter what, until you spend it to improve your character. ",

For instance, when striking a foe with an axe, use your Combat trait, plus any boosts to it, to determine the damage you deal. Power Traits represent technical skill and physical strength.

Intimidate is your ability to gain the upper hand in social situations through the application of force.

However, there may come a time when a Hero needs to lift or carry a particularly heavy object, such as a cannonball, person, or even a statue! Heroes can lift an amount of weight based on their Athletics score, and the number of hands they use, per the table below. (Weights are calculated in pounds.) . When carrying an “easy” load or less, a Hero can move about without issue. When carrying a “burdened” load or less, each square you enter costs an additional Movement. When more than “burdened”, they cannot move at all, but can still lift the object off the ground. If an object weighs so much that it exceeds the “2h Impossible” number (or exceeds 2h Burdened and the Hero has only one hand to spare), then the Hero cannot lift the object at all.

There’s a big difference between fighting five puny Bokoblin, and fighting five hulking Talus. | Monster Type | # Heroes Equal To | . | Normal | 1 Hero | . | Swarm | 8 HP per Hero | . | Heavy | 1.5 Heroes | . | Miniboss | 2 Heroes | . | Boss | 4 Heroes | . A Boss, for instance, is the equal of a full group of 4 Heroes. These fierce foes are a deadly challenge all on their own! . A Miniboss is the equal of two Heroes; as such, it’s common to find Minibosses paired together, with a small retinue of Normal foes or a Swarm, or in a room full of traps. A Heavy monster is equal to about one and a half Heroes. They’ll often be paired with a crew of Normal foes. A Swarm is typically a fair match for a Hero per every 8 Hit Points it has. Thus, a Swarm of Keese with 16 Hit Points is a fair fight for a pair of Heroes. ",

If your Heroes are packing all Rank 2 weapons and armor, then they are probably up to the task of fighting a full complement of Rank 2 foes. Don’t be afraid to vary this, especially when Heroes are comfortable with foes and equipment of a particular Rank… but you may want to do this slowly. One or two Rank 3 enemies, with some Rank 2 backup, will challenge Heroes in Rank 2 gear – and give them a start on getting Rank 3 items. No need to jump to a full group of Rank 3 foes right out; that could be a very difficult fight. In general, a single Normal foe of Rank (N) is equal to about 2 Normal foes of Rank (N-1), in terms of difficulty. ",

We recommend an encounter (that isn’t just a single Boss monster) have at least two different Monster Roles represented. Having different Roles ensures that the foes the Heroes fight aren’t all just clones of the same guy, and gives them something to chew on while they plan their tactics! . A Rallier might help keep a Warrior healthy during a fight, or assist a Hunter in side-stepping the Heroes; Protectors help keep Blasters safe, or keep Heroes from escaping the grasp of a Swarm of lesser foes. Exactly how the Roles help one another varies from one Monster to the next, but that interplay gives Heroes an interesting dynamic to suffer from, observe, and then interrupt to their own advantage.

Things that block line of sight, slow combatants down, or force them to consider the terrain in their strategies, all serve to make the fight more challenging and dynamic. Be sure to consider how the Heroes and the foes might interact with the terrain. Can they set it on fire? Push it around? Activate it with a switch? Climb it, break through it, dig under it, fly over it, swim through it? Terrain that’s interactive is more interesting than obstacles that simply sit there, after all. In general, neither the Heroes nor their foes should be right up against a map’s edge, unless one side is backed up against a literal wall. It’s important to give both sides room to maneuver, in whatever direction they choose, at the fight’s outset. Also, keep in mind that bigger foes require more open space to maneuver in! . ",

For instance, if bandits are defending their territory from invading Heroes, they might be ensconced in defensive positions on the high ground, or have placed traps in strategic locations. If ravenous monsters are attacking the Heroes in the hopes of a filling meal, they may try to flank them to prevent their escape, or intimidate them by howling. In both cases, you tell a story about the Heroes’ enemies, without them standing up and giving a speech about their motivations. ",

    "content": "Finally, consider what, if anything, you may want to do to give the encounter its own unique spin. Twists help keep encounters from feeling ‘same-y’ – two fights against similar foes can feel very different, if their twists help separate them. One common way to do this in Reclaim the Wild is to give the foes equipment that differs from their typical listed loadout – whether it’s better or worse for them. A brigand with a Fairy Dagger might have something interesting to say about how he got it, while a Darknut wearing tattered scraps of cloth instead of their typical heavy plate armor might belie a past they would prefer be forgotten. Another way to do this is to have something happen during or after the fight begins. For instance, if the ceiling cave begins to collapse, or lava begins to rise, that livens the fight up and keeps Heroes on their toes. Finally, the twist might come at the end of the fight. Perhaps the foes were an illusion, or were keeping some larger foe in check. Not every fight needs a twist! In fact, if every fight has a twist, then nothing will be surprising anymore. Use them sparingly, and they’ll keep their power to perk up a Hero’s ears – and send chills through their heart. ",

In some cases, you may want to create a new Technique, Spell, or other special attacks for your monstrous creations to use. First, consider if an existing attack could simply be tweaked to serve a new purpose. You can change an attack’s Element, inflicted Status, or from a Spell to a Technique (or vice-versa) with little worry. If that won’t do, however, you can get a feel for the balance of a new attack like so: . | Start with the number of targets the attack would usually hit when using Abstract Combat Ranges. | Then, multiply by the attack’s damage multiplier. If it’s a Weapon + Combat attack, multiply by 1; if it’s Weapon + (3 x Combat), you multiply by 3, etc. | If the attack has additional beneficial effects, such as inflicting a status effect, multiply by 1.25. If it has a downside or can only be used in some circumstances, multiply by 0.9. If both, then do nothing. | Finally, divide by Magic or Stamina cost. | . Ideally, your result will be about 0.33 – this indicates that your new attack is (probably) balanced. If your result is less than that, then your attack might be too weak or costly. If the number is higher, it may be too powerful. ",

If the Weapon, Civilian Clothing, or Armor you are deconstructing has an Enchantment, you may also obtain a single Gem, of the deconstructed Enchantment’s Rank. The Gem’s Type is the same as the Type of Gem used to originally enchant the item – for instance, deconstructing a weapon with the Forceful Enchantment (which requires using a Ruby) will always yield a Ruby. You cannot deconstruct just the Enchantment on a piece of equipment – you can only break the whole thing apart. You may, however, overwrite an Enchantment, enchanting the equipment as if it had no original Enchantment. ",

While some adventurers would characterize them as nuisances – or worse, overly-pushy salespersons – many Deku simply want a peaceful life, just like anyone else. Deku Scrubs are made of plant matter, and are biologically more akin to bushes than anything else. Their skin is made of thin-barked wood, their heads covered in a bushy clump of leaves (rich green or autumn\u0002colored), and their eyes are featureless amber pools. Deku Scrubs have a large, open snout, shaped like a trumpet, working as both their nose and mouth. Deku Scrubs tend to live in mossy grottos, holes in the ground, or hidden amongst the bushes in forests and plains. Large groups of Deku Scrubs might create buildings or even fortress-like trading posts made of logs and vines; however, it’s rare that Deku Scrubs gather together like this, as most prefer to live alone or in very small groups. Deku Scrubs are renowned all over Hyrule as merchants, and it’s not uncommon to find a lone Deku Scrub with rare (and expensive) wares to sell, hidden in a copse of trees or within a forgotten cavern. Some Deku Scrubs have even served as neutral parties in important negotiations, like peace treaties, thanks to their reputation as open-minded, profit-driven merchants. ",

They can also be quite patient – some would say ‘stubborn’ – and will hold their ground in the face of social pressure. Travelers will tell tales of Deku Scrubs that have held firm in the middle of a road for days or weeks, just to prove a point or win some small concession. When faced with a new culture, most Deku Scrubs will quietly walk around and observe the people and how they act, acting for all the world like a simple bush as they plop down to watch. Once they have confidence in how to interact with these new people, though, a Deku Scrub will often dive right in, trying to make friends and integrate themselves into that culture. Their legendary stubbornness makes Deku Scrubs well-suited to handle foes who use their social skill to their advantage, whether on the battlefield, at the negotiating table, or in heated discussions before the throne. Some Deku Scrubs prefer to ambush foes: waiting in bushes or thickets, and popping up to strike passing foes. They thus tend to prefer small, easily-concealed weapons, like crossbows, clubs, and daggers. Deku Scrubs also often have a bit of magic to them, using the Vanish spell to blind opponents before scurrying off, or using Kyameron’s Splash to cause damage and snuff out flames. Characteristics: Greedy, Lonesome, Neutral, Skittish, Stubborn, Quiet . Names: Unlike most races, Deku Scrubs do not have given names, recognizing one another by the unique sound of their rustling leaves. When they do take on names, they tend to start with “De-“, such as Decci, Dekki, and Deppi. ",

Despite this, many Deku Scrubs enjoy talking with passers-by, and seem to be quite friendly. Scholars who study Deku Scrubs have long been curious about this seemingly contradictory mindset. Some theorize that this desire to live alone, or at most, in a small group, stems from a kind of plant instinct: much as one tree might shade another, preventing it from getting the sunlight it needs to grow and thrive, so too might too many neighbors crowd a Deku Scrub out of hole and home. However, a simple passer-by poses no such threat: much like an animal passing by a tree, a moment’s shadow is no concern, particularly when weighed against the benefits of having that animal nearby. While most Deku Scrubs might not be able to explain whether this theory is right or not, they can feel it in their bark: too many people, all in one place, is no place for them. While they might be eager to visit a new town, they’ll often be just as eager to head back out into the wild, where things are much quieter and more spread out. Conveniently, a typical group of adventurers is just at the upper limits of the group-size that most Deku Scrubs’ instincts will tolerate. ",

Though they may first sprout in forests watched over by powerful nature spirits, Koroks are insatiably curious, and are prone to wander. Observant scholars have noted the similarity between Koroks’ origins, and the origins of the Kokiri.

Many of these tales are true, but they are not the whole truth: on occasion, there are those Demons who walk a Hero’s path, for reasons that might be altruistic, selfish, or simply inscrutable. Demons have two forms: their demonic form, monstrous and deadly; and a more benign shape, suitable for mingling with – and manipulating – mortals. A Demon’s demonic form has leathery skin, and brightly-colored hair caught in an eternal, unseen wind. Some demonic forms might have curved horns, bat-like wings, bestial lower halves, or glowing sigils etched into their skin. A Demon’s benign form is indistinguishable from a Hylian, Gerudo, or Sheikah at a glance. A closer look might reveal pallid skin and sunken eyes. While nothing says that a Demon’s mortal guise couldn’t be a Deku, Zora, or Fairy, they cannot effectively mimic those races’ innate talents, making them poor disguises.

Those that decide to act heroically often have reason to withhold their true nature; even after performing good deeds, many people find it hard to not flee in terror at the sight of a demon, let alone to accept them into their lives. In part because of this mistrust by most in Hyrule, many Demons prefer to work subtly around the edges of a problem, gathering information and leverage, in their mortal guises. Most Demons will wait until they have found a weakness to exploit before striking, decisively and brutally, to exploit that weakness and end the problem – by any means necessary. Demons are well-suited to combine both physical combat and magical prowess; in their demonic forms, they can combine the might of both styles into devastating bursts of destruction.

So why would a Demon ever deign to lower themselves to committing heroic acts? . Some Demons are cursed by well-meaning wizards, forced into a lesser form until such time as they mend their ways. While their journey as a Hero might begin as a self\u0002serving way to break their curse, they might grow into goodness as they go, making it at first a habit, and then a part of their nature.This outcome, rather than mere punishment, may be the intent of such curses. Not all Demons need necessarily be truly evil at heart. Perhaps, like most other races, some Demons are naturally good people, and truly do want to do good things solely for their own sake. For some Demons, though, heroism is simply an act, a means to an end. They may seek to establish themselves as a worthy heir to a kingdom’s throne, or to make themselves “good enough” to be able to wield some powerful (and powerfully warded) magical artefact. Such Demons are often faced with a crisis of conscience when they achieve their goals, forced to confront whether they are evil, good, or something else altogether. For a few long-lived and powerful Demons, being an adventuring Hero might just be something to try for a while. After a few thousand years of conquest, destruction, or just petty curses, being a “good guy” is simply a change of pace. These Demons might stick with it for a lifetime or two before getting bored and trying something else, but hopefully, their brief time as a Hero leaves a lasting mark on them nonetheless. ",

Elemental Chaff Cost: 6 Stamina Use Requirement: A Weapon with the Elemental Weapon Enchantment Range: Blast 2 (Arcane Weapons), Cone 2 (Melee Weapons), Line 4 (Ranged Weapons) Damage: Weapon + (Enchantment Rank), of the weapon’s Element Effect: Roll To-Hit target’s Concentration; on success, target is inflicted with the element’s corresponding status effect (see the table below). | Gemstone | Element | Status Effect | Additional Effects | . | Diamond | Light | Cursed Casts | Fair Light, radius (Rank) | . | Emerald | Earth | Rusted Resist | Rain (Rank) | . | Onyx | Dark | Sick | Exudes black smoke* | . | Opal | Water | Soaked | Resist Sandstorm (Rank) | . | Ruby | Fire | On Fire | Resist Coldsnap (Rank) | . | Sapphire | Ice | Slowed | Resist Heatwave (Rank) | . | Topaz | Shock | Off-Balance | Generates electricity | . *Onyx weapons exude a black smoke that can obscure vision when held steady (IE, placed on the ground, or when held by a user who is not in combat). This smoke may fill a single square, and generally prevents light from shining through. Perception checks made through the smoke take a (Rank) penalty, and light sources within the smoke have their Rank (or radius) reduced by (Rank). Forceful . Uses: Ruby Equipment Type: Any Weapon Effect: Rolls To-Hit Vitality made with this weapon are increased by (1 + (Rank / 2)). Hydrodynamic . Uses: Opal Equipment Type: Any Weapon Effect: If fighting while underwater, foes are not Hard to Hit simply because you are not a Natural Swimmer. If this weapon is a Ranged Weapon, Fire and Bomb Arrows shot from it work just as well as they would on dry land. This weapon does not suffer ill effects from being exposed to fresh or salt water. Loyal . Uses: Topaz Equipment: Any Weapon Effect: As a Minor Action, you may call this weapon to your empty hand. The weapon must be within line of sight, and must be able to pass through the intervening space between itself and your hand. If the weapon is held by another creature, you may make a Disarm attempt against the Creature as part of this Minor Action, with a bonus equal to the Enchantment’s Rank. Mirrored . Uses: Diamond Equipment Type: Any Weapon Effect: When you Parry or Deflect with this weapon, your Defense is increased by (Rank) for this attack (before reducing the damage from Deflect or Parry). The foe that attacked you takes (Rank) damage, unmitigated by Defense. Multi-Shot . Uses: Onyx Equipment Type: Any Weapon Effect: When you do a Ranged Basic Attack with this weapon, fire (1 + (Rank / 2)) mini-shots, with your original attack’s range, each dealing (1+Rank) damage, ignoring Defense. Mini-shots must be fired at foes other than your original target(s), and each mini-shot must target a different foe. (These targeting rules do not apply when attacking Swarms.) . Mini-Shots do not consume ammunition, and they do not require a Roll To-Hit to land, but cannot strike anything that is Hard to Hit. Damage-reducing Reactions reduce the damage of a mini-shot to zero. Mini-shots cannot take on the properties of ammunition, Enchantments, or other additional effects. Any additional mini-shots not used by the end of your turn disappear. Perfectly Balanced . Uses: Any Gem Equipment Type: Any Weapon Effect: The weapon’s Attack Power, Durability, Accuracy, and Critical Hit range are increased, as per the table below. | Rank | ACC | ATK | DUR | CRIT | . | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | . | 1 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 0 | . | 2 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 | . | 3 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 1 | . | 4 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 2 | . | 5 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 2 | . Quickshot . Uses: Topaz Equipment Type: Any Weapon Effect: When you make a Ranged Basic Attack using this weapon, roll ((2 x Rank) + Weapon’s ACC) vs. target’s Concentration; on success, they may not use Reactions against that attack. Silvered . Uses: Diamond Equipment Type: Any Weapon Effect: Foes who are considered a great evil (see Ancient &amp; Irredeemable Evil), or are serving or controlled by a great evil, have a Vulnerability to this weapon. This weapon may also trigger a foe’s Weak Point. (These effects only occur if the foe’s Rank is equal to or less than this Enchantment’s; otherwise, this Enchantment does nothing.) . Tracer . Uses: Luminous Stone Equipment Type: Any Weapon Effect: When you land a Ranged Basic Attack using this weapon, your target is illuminated until the end of your next turn. While lit up, they cast Radius (Rank) Dim Light and lose (Rank / 2) Evasion. ",

    "content": "Some players or groups may not want to actively track their Bound, Burnt, and Spent Magic and Stamina. If that’s the case for you, we present these rules. First, halve the listed cost for all Techniques and Spells, rounding down. For example, the Spin Attack Technique, which has a listed cost of 8 Stamina, would now have a listed cost of 4 Stamina. Feats and Racial Bonuses that reduce Spell and Technique costs function as written, and their values are NOT halved. They reduce the adjusted listed cost of Spells or Techniques. Heroes may now use any Spell or Technique they know that has a listed cost equal to, or less than, their Stamina or Magic Trait. For instance, a Hero with 5 points in their Stamina Trait can use Spin Attack as much as they like, while a character with a 3 in their Stamina Trait would be unable to use Spin Attack at all. You may only have a single Bound Spell or Technique active at a time. Having a Spell or Technique Bound does not alter your Stamina or Magic Traits, allowing you to still use high-cost Techniques and Spells while you have your Bound effect active. If a Spell or Technique Burns Stamina or Magic, instead, simply cross it out – that Spell or Technique cannot be used again until you take an Extended Rest. When you consume a Dish or Elixir that restores Stamina or Magic, instead restore the use of one Burned Spell or Technique. ",

    "content": "Some foes may have an Enrage mechanic – under certain circumstances, they become even more dangerous. While Enraged, you might increase any number of a foe’s Traits by up to +2, or just a few Traits by up to +4. You might increase its Movement, grant it new Elemental or Status Resistances or Immunities, change its Defense category, or grant it access to new Spells or Techniques. During some Enrage mechanics, the Monster might lose Traits – for instance, they might be blinded with rage, losing Perception. Whatever Traits or stats are changed, it’s important to make it clear to Heroes that the Monster’s become Enraged. Be sure to show that the foe has gotten meaner or stronger! . All Enrage mechanics must have a trigger, and that trigger typically requires external input – a Hero’s actions, or environmental factors, have to be the cause of the monster’s increased power. Some Enrage mechanics may also have means to un\u0002enrage the monster, at least for a time; this is more common with Bosses, where they may cycle through calm and Enraged states multiple times throughout a fight. Giving enemies Enrage mechanics is a fun way to keep players engaged and on their toes, and make sure a battle doesn’t become rote or predictable.

    "content": "Rank 0 equipment is improvised from the scraps you might find around you, or are simple implements that are not originally intended for combat. Pot lids, soup ladles, toy hammers, and the like, all are Rank 0. So too are old rags, mud-boots, and other items that are meant to be used and abused. Rank 1 weapons are simple everyday items, the kind that any peasant might keep under their bed, or that any waystation might sell to a traveler hard-up on supplies. Rank 1 armor is considered useful protection by most villagers, and Rank 1 clothing would be worn for going out to market or to a friend’s house for dinner. They can be made by nearly any blacksmith – and often are, in large numbers. Rank 2 weapons and armor are the ones larger towns use for their guards, or that kingdoms with standing armies give to the common infantryman. Rank 2 clothing would be considered a villager’s “good” clothing, worn when family visits or during minor ceremonies. They have some real care put into their crafting, but are still not so ornate that a large village’s best blacksmith or tailor cannot make one upon request. Rank 3 weapons and armors are typically found on knights, captains, or warriors of some small renown and wealth. This equipment may have some filigree, subtle gilding, or the stamp of a proud craftsman. Rank 3 clothing is likewise gilded and gossamer, generally seen more on nobles, rich merchants, or perhaps a lucky peasant’s wedding dress or festival finery. Not every blacksmith can make equipment this fine, and a small town or village might not have anyone quite practiced or capable enough to do so. Cities typically have at least one or two smiths who can craft at this level. Rank 4 equipment is, generally, considered the best you can reasonably expect to ever get your hands on. These are reserved for royalty, used by their guards or buried in ancient crypts with their mummified remains. Rank 4 clothing is what you would expect a noble to wear to their own funeral, or what a king might wear to receive important guests. Even in a large city, it will be rare to find a smith who can accomplish the task of making such a weapon – harder still to get on their waiting list, their good side, or to even get their attention. Rank 5 weapons, armor, and clothing are even better than that, though. These are the true masterworks, legendary equipment that will be spoken of over campfires and in tavern songs for generations. Even a king might not have knowledge of where a piece of such splendor lies, or if he did, would only use it in the most important of ceremonies or the direst of circumstances. Perhaps a single master smith in an entire kingdom might be capable of creating such gear. ",

    "doc": "Everything Breaks",
    "title": "Everything Breaks",
    "content": "By default, only Weapons have Durability in Reclaim the Wild. Armor and Tools can be used infinitely, assuming they aren’t abused. However, some groups or GMs may prefer that all equipment wear down with repeated use, and eventually break. They may want all of a player’s equipment to work the same way, or they may want players to have that extra concern of durability when using their tools or getting into battles. While having all equipment use Durability increases the amount of bookkeeping players have to do, it can add an extra survivalist edge to the Heroes’ adventures. Under this rule, Tools and Armors have the following Durability. | Rank | Armor | Clothing &amp; Tools | . | 0 | 6 | 3 | . | 1 | 12 | 6 | . | 2 | 18 | 9 | . | 3 | 24 | 12 | . | 4 | 32 | 16 | . | 5 | 40 | 20 | . Armor (including Clothing) loses one point of Durability after every combat encounter they are used in, just as weapons do. An Armor or Clothing is considered to have been used if the Hero wearing it was struck and damaged by anything, including terrain hazards. Simply benefitting from an Armor’s Enchantment does not count as being ‘used’ for the purposes of Durability. Tools lose one point of Durability whenever they are used for their intended purpose. When used for an unintended purpose – a use that would destroy the Tool in the base rules – they instead lose two points of Durability. In this way, this particular Master Mode rule is friendlier to clever players and imaginative use of Tools. Since players will be using more Materials over the long run, the GM should increase the Materials gained from Monsters or resources by 1. This rule pairs well with the Repairing and Upgrading Mundane Weapons Assist Mode rule. Using these two rules together help balance their changes against one another, resulting in a fulfilling experience: everything breaks, but everything can be repaired, too. When these rules are used together, their adjustments to Material gain rates cancel each other out. ",

A Mixed Extended Challenge may use a wide variety of Traits – the GM may provide a list of (usually four or more) allowed Traits, or may allow the Heroes to use any Trait so long as they can roleplay and explain their reasoning for it. In a Mixed Challenge, each Hero may only use a given Trait once, so they must be prepared to mix it up and show off the breadth of their skills and knowledge. A player may come up with a great idea to use a Trait that was not on the provided list, which the GM may then allow; or they may be trying to shoehorn in a usage of their most powerful Trait, which the GM would then not allow.

    "title": "Fair Market Prices",
    "content": "In Reclaim the Wild, shopkeepers buy low, and sell high. This simple economic strategy can be rough on Heroes: unless they haggle, they’ll find that their goods sell for half the Market Price, and that they buy goods at twice the Market Price. This disparity means that Heroes are encouraged to seek out the specific Materials and items that they need, and to craft their own equipment. Buying things from a merchant is a way to get around shortfalls, or to profit from items that you otherwise won’t use, but shouldn’t be your first choice to source your gear. However, this economic system adds complexity and difficulty to shopping trips. It expects Heroes to haggle for their goods, which can take valuable time away from a session of play. It also encourages Heroes to seek out one-for-one trades instead of simply accepting and using Rupees, which can add complexity to trade interactions. If you want a kinder, gentler economy for your game, then consider the following rule: . All Equipment, Items, and Materials are bought and sold for their Market Price. Further, we recommend that you disallow further Haggling over prices. This means that you can easily trade Materials one-for-one using Rupees – for example, Washed Wool sells for 20 Rupees, and Tykogi Iron costs 20 Rupees. An easy – and now, lossless – swap to make! . This does not preclude Heroes from using their Influence to try and get better rewards from people seeking help. At the GM’s discretion, it may not even prevent Heroes from Haggling over prices at all. However, be aware that if you allow Heroes to sell items for more than their Market Price, or to buy them for less, less-scrupulous players may attempt to make infinite money. ",

    "content": "Adventurers from all sorts of places tell tales of Fairies – small beings, the size of a person’s hand or forearm, able to heal wounds with a flick of a wand. Others tell of even more powerful Great Fairies, giants who grant powerful boons to those who fulfill their quests. Between those, however, are another kind of Fairy: the Fairy Hero. Fairies (of all sizes) have gossamer, insect\u0002esque wings on their back. They appear much like Hylians at a glance, but their hair and eyes might be any color one can dream of; on closer inspection, one might find that Fairies have lighter, more lithe builds than most Hylians do. Their most distinguishing feature is their glow: Fairies glow with natural magic, and while they can dampen this glow with a little mental effort, they can just as easily forget and let it slip out. Fairies live in the hidden places of the world, where good magic seems to coalesce: at natural, crystal-clear springs; in sparkling grottos; or in consecrated, holy places. They do not build houses or towns, preferring to indulge in exploring the natural world: playing under bushes and darting through the trees, dancing on flowers and getting into trouble with local wildlife. Fairies begin life quite small, just the size of a person’s thumb, but grow steadily through the course of decades. After a century or three, they reach the size of other Humanoid races, leaving their hidden homes to seek out adventure, or to complete a quest given them by a powerful patron, like a Great Fairy or Deku Tree. After another few centuries (if a Fairy survives that long), they will have reached the size of a small house, becoming a Great Fairy; they then seek out a hidden place of their own to claim and bless, making it a home for all Fairies. Some scholars theorize that Great Fairies eventually transform into a horde of pint-sized Fairies, though no one has ever seen such an event occur naturally. ",

    "content": "Fairies are typically conscientious, caring, and eager to help a kind soul in need. They feel a kinship to the natural world, and while Fairy Heroes might find company in cities or towns, they will feel most at home in the untouched wild. Most Fairies believe strongly in retribution and karma: good begets good, evil begets evil, and they will often be glad to step in and participate in the consequences of someone else’s actions. They might do so in a mischievous way, inflicting ironic punishments on ne’er-do-wells, rather than harsh retribution or bloody vengeance. Thanks to their ability to speak with animals, many Fairies see them as equals. They might find that a household pet is more interesting to talk to than anyone else in the room, or they might be concerned (or even furious!) at how a farm-mule is treated, asking the donkey its opinions. Fairies are classically seen as healers of the sick and battle-weary, and healing-minded Fairy Heroes are no exception. Their ability to fly, and their natural spellcasting abilities, make them valuable as nimble mages, delivering spells (helpful or harmful) where they are needed most. Characteristics: Caring, Emotional, Magical, Playful, Puckish, Vindictive . Fairy Names tend to be short (2-3 syllables) forms of verbs or objects. Female Names: Ciela, Felicia, Miff, Neri, Proxi, Ribbon, Spryte, Tatl . Male Names: Hearth, Leaf, Tael, Venture . ",

    "title": "Fairies and Size",
    "content": "Fairy Heroes may either be “person-sized”, or the typical “fairy size”. This should be a decision made in concert with the GM. Person-sized Fairies are larger than the small Fairies one might find at a Fairy Spring, but much smaller than the Great Fairies that might lord over those same places. They tend to be between the size of a child and an adult Hylian. Because they are sized properly to wield weapons, wear armor, and use items, they cannot magically shrink items to ‘typical fairy’ size. If a Fairy Hero would be ‘fairy-sized’, then they are about 1-2 hands high – the size of a typical healing Fairy found at a Fairy Spring, or perhaps a little bit bigger. They can still pick up and use items and equipment, magically shrinking any itemsthey pick up. If they drop or lose possession of a shrunken object, it returns to its normal size. (Items cannot be dropped if they would expand to larger than the area the Fairy currently occupies). ",

    "content": "While scouting out in the wilderness, Savelle the Hylian rogue makes a campfire to keep warm for the night. He’s found several Hylian Shrooms (Rank 1, no effect) that day. He could eat one raw, and it would restore a single Hit Point. He decides instead to cook them; since he lacks a Cooking Vessel, he opts to roast them over a campfire, one at a time. Each Dish (a Roasted Mushroom) restores 2 HP when eaten. A few days (and one trip to a nearby town) later, Savelle has purchased a cast-iron wok (Rank 1 Cooking Vessel), which will allow him to cook more than one ingredient at a time over a fire. Since his Cooking Vessel is only Rank 1, it can only contain 3 ingredients at a time. (See the Mundane Tools section.) . This time, his scouting has found not only a Hearty Truffle (Rank 3, Hearty), but he catches some Armored Carp (Rank 2, Tough) in the nearby river, as well. With the Hylian Shrooms he still has from before, Savelle can make quite a nice spread! . Savelle puts two Hylian Shrooms in his pot with the Armored Carp, and begins cooking. Adding the Ranks of the items up (1 + 1 + 2), plus the number of Ingredients in the dish (3) equals 7 – the Dish’s Point Value. Savelle could leave it at that, and have a Dish that restores 7 HP, but he decides to bring out the special effect of the Carp. The Dish’s Point Value is high enough to allow for a Rank 1 effect. Thus, Savelle creates a Seafood-Mushroom Skewer, which restores 4 HP, and grants TOugh (Rank 1), when consumed. After another few days, Savelle returns to town. While staying at the Inn, he decides to make use of the kitchen. Since this is a full-featured kitchen in a civilized town, he can use 5 Ingredients in his Dish. Savelle decides to celebrate by making a veritable feast of a Dish, using the Hearty Truffle and the remainder of his Hylian Shrooms. Savelle only has a Cooking Trait of 4, though, so while the Hearty Truffle is Rank 3, he must treat it as a Rank 2 item – a cook even marginally more skilled than Savelle could bring out the full power and flavor of the Hearty Truffle. Savelle throws 4 Hylian Shrooms and the Hearty Truffle into the pot. He adds up the Ranks of the items (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2), plus the number of Ingredients in the Dish (5), for a total of 11. As before, he can choose to bring out the special property of the Hearty Truffle, and does so, choosing to have the Hearty effect grant half the Dish’s Point Value in Temporary Hit Points. This means the Dish will restore 6 HP, and grant 5 Temporary Hit Points, when consumed. ",

    "content": "Ancient items are often used in the most powerful and deadly equipment, with blades or shielding made out of solid light. Ancient weapons tend to be quite useful against Ancient Guardians and in deflecting blows from other Ancient weapons. Ancient material is only found in forgotten ruins, by defeating Guardians and other Ancient technology, or by scavenging the worn-out refuse from battles with the same. The secrets to creating Ancient materials are lost today, and they are not found in nature. Ancient materials can be used anytime Cloth, Metal, or Wood materials can. They do not conduct electricity, are not magnetic, do not rust in the rain, and do not catch fire – in short, Ancient materials will never betray you. Cloth tends to be the simplest material to work with, but is unsuitable for weapon-making. It can only be used to make Civilian clothing, Light Armor, Medium Armor, Packs, and some Tools, but it may also be used in lots of miscellaneous civilian applications. Critters are used in creating Elixirs. Every Elixir requires at least one Critter, and Critters can be found just about anywhere. (Critters are insects, lizards, snails, and other small, low-order animals, the size of a person’s hand.) Critters are also cheaper to buy or sell than most other types of Materials. Gemstones are used in Enchanting. They can be found in many of the same places that Metals can, such as ore nodes – but since gemstones have been valued since ages long passed, they can also be found in treasure hordes, tombs, or dungeons. Food materials are used in crafting, well, food. Many of these can be eaten raw for very minor benefits, but are far and away better used in cooking actual Dishes. Food Ingredients are also cheaper to buy or sell than most other types of Materials. Metal is the most common material to make arms and armor out of. Metallic items are susceptible to magnetic and electric attacks, including attracting lightning during thunderstorms. Metal can be used to make Medium and Heavy Armor, as well as any kind of weapon. Monster Parts aren’t used to make things on their own, but the various substances contained in different monsters’ parts can have useful properties for a wide variety of applications, including smithing, alchemy, and enchanting. This makes them valuable as a supplement to all other Material types. Wood is typically used in the construction of bows and shields, but is occasionally used for spears, boomerangs, and even swords. Wooden objects are susceptible to fire, and will burn to ash in your hands if you let them. Wood can be used to make weapons and shields, but not armor. It can also be used to make fires, or to build houses and other large structures. | Material | Seek With | Harvest With | . | Ancient | Arcana | Mechanics | . | Cloth | Nature | Smithing | . | Critters | Nature | Agility | . | Gemstones | Arcana | Enchanting | . | Food | Civilization | Cooking | . | Metal | Civilization | Smithing | . | Monster Parts | (Varies) | (Varies) | . | Wood | Nature | Smithing | .

A Gem’s type determines the Enchantments it can provide: for instance, if you wanted to enchant a weapon to produce fire, you’d need to find a Ruby – no other type of Gem will do. A Gem’s type is typically based on its location, taking on the properties of the environment.

A monster’s Difficulty and other attributes (such as whether it wields a Natural Weapon) determine the number of Monster Parts you obtain. The monster’s Rank determines the quality of the parts you obtain from it, just like with a resource you might find in the wilderness. Taking parts from Monsters does not use up any of your weapons’ Durability, and does not require any Harvesting Tools. After all, you’ve already damaged them enough just bringing your foes down in the first place. Creatures from player races – Hylians, Zora, etc. – do not give Monster Parts.

Gerudo are exceptionally tall, with lean, muscular frames built for quick movement and light steps.

Gerudo often live in sandy climates: primarily arid deserts, but some bands are found on beaches or rocky cliff-faces. These desolate, isolated homes do not have many resources, so more isolated bands of Gerudo become bandits, pirates, and thieves. Gerudo clans in more well-traveled locations might be merchant hubs and oasis towns, allowing traders and travelers to come to them. Thanks to the distinct lack of male Gerudo, many Gerudo women leave home in order to find “boyfriends” with which to continue their line.

Gerudo magic-users are rare, but not unheard-of - some of the world’s most dangerous magic users have been Gerudo, though many of those examples used their power for evil purposes. Gerudo have a tendancy to think in terms of monolithic cultures, rather than individual persons, when considering their actions and consequences. Gerudo are deeply aware of their culture’s image in the eyes of others: some Gerudo bands become pirates or bandits, and in the distant past, Gerudo clans united under the banner of an evil wizard-king. A Gerudo Hero traveling abroad knows that their decisions reflect on their culture as a whole, but they may miss how they are seen by individuals, leading to misunderstandings and culture clashes. Gerudo are often seen as stoic or harsh by other races, but they view themselves as forthright and honest. A Gerudo will state what they want, and then take action to achieve those goals - sometimes, without considering how their statements and actions could be misconstrued. The Gerudo’s mono-gendered nature means that they find kinship with the women of other races, whether they themselves are male or female. The few male Gerudo who escape their settlements may find males of other cultures strange, but will often try as hard as they can to fit in with them, seeking a kinship they simply cannot find at home. In fact, learning about other cultures in general is seen as a wise, strategic move among Gerudo - not only for seeking friends, but also in finding mates, forging trade deals, or to suss out weaknesses to exploit. Gerudo Heroes often prefer swords, be they Greatswords, a Sword and Shield, or a Sword in each hand. Their scimitars are famous for their beauty, speed, and strength - just as the Gerudo themselves are. Characteristics: Forthright, Lithe, Nomadic, Romantic, Stoic, Traditional, Warrior .

Gorons are tall and rotund, with wide potbellies and large, chestnut-shaped heads, compared to their relatively thin arms and legs. Their skin is earthen, rough to the touch like hewn stone. Gorons do not have hair, per se, but they develop colorful outcroppings of stone on their chin, brow, back, and scalp as they enter adulthood, which then turn white with age. Their eyes are beady, like small polished stones, without irises or other distinguishing features. Gorons live in large networks of caves, and prefer climates that most would find ‘warm’ to ‘impossibly scorching’. They hew their caves into the side of single mountain - or better yet, an active volcano. Settlement sites are chosen based on the quality of the local rock, as well as what amenities are nearby - like hot springs, lava floes, or even active volcanoes. A typical Goron home might appear primitive and spartan to visitors, with simple decorations of tribal-patterned vases or rough-stitched tapestries, a fire pit, and perhaps some slabs of stone to serve as table, chair, and bed. Thanks to their unique physical composition, Gorons can eat rocks and metals. They have a rich culinary culture, and the few Goron foods that are palatable to other species, such as the famed Goron Spice, are considered rare and valuable delicacies. ",

In this way, as in all ways, they are like a stone - hard to move, but once moved, even harder to stop. However, that does not mean Gorons are dour or uncaring. Rather, Gorons have a reputation for a kind of steadfast innocence and obliviousness: when something bad happens, many Gorons simply shrug their shoulders, and continue on as best as they can. Goron Heroes may change their course at bad news, but even they will simply ready themselves to take on a new challenge without belaboring the point. Because of this, few beings rebound from emotional or physical turmoil more quickly than a Goron. Of course, Gorons famously love eating a good rock – they’ll speak rhapsodically about its flavor, or curiously sample the taste of new rocks as they come across them. To a Goron, no rock is “just a rock”, and each stone tells a story with its taste and texture. Gorons value sheer physical strength and endurance. Gorons make friends by inviting one another to attempt contests of might and constitution. Simply making a good effort may be enough to get into a Goron’s good graces, but succeeding at the test is a sure way to gain friendship. Gorons are quick to recognize those who succeed or surpass them, and are rarely jealous – instead, they welcome the victor like a new brother. Gorons Heroes typically favor melee physical combat, preferring to enter the fray and bash foes like an unstoppable avalanche. Goron legends speak highly of hammers, as well as simply punching foes directly – so many Goron Heroes use hammers, mauls, and Fist weapons, in the spirit of their ancestors.

Others say that Gorons are not so much ‘born’ as they are hewn from the rock, carved like a statue or grown like a geode, and then given life by magic. A third theory states that Gorons are like trees or flowers, having the capacity to work as either gender as the situation demands. Their identification as ‘bro’ is merely a quirk of language or culture – or a reflection on those observing them. Gorons are also unique for their diet, preferring rocks over other nutrients. They appear to prefer simple stone to all else, followed by metals as a mid-quality food, and ending with gems as a sour, unappetizing foodstuff. Despite their unique culinary capability, Gorons are happy to partake in the foods that other races eat. In particular, Gorons seem to enjoy spicy foods, and their famed Goron Spice (a kind of sweet, spicy curry powder) is famed far and wide. Finally, once every few generations, a Goron is born who grows monumentally huge, rivaling the size of some mountains.

During a Short or Extended Rest, a Hero must consume a Dish to stave off Hunger.

Whenever a Hero fails to eat the necessary amount of food during a Short or Extended Rest, they gain a Rank of Hunger. At the end of an Extended Rest, Heroes lose (Hunger Rank) HP.

The greatest skill of the Hylian race is their adaptability: moreso than other races, Hylians can adapt to any challenge. Hylians are humanoid, and look much like you or I do - with the sole difference of long, pointed ears, extending either upwards or outwards, depending on the person. Legend says that the unique structure of their ears allows Hylians to hear the words of the Goddesses, but most scholars agree that this is simply apocryphal. Hylians live wherever they can, and are the most likely among all races to make their home in towns built by other races. It’s not uncommon to find a few Hylians in every town, wearing specially-made clothing to handle the climate. Given the choice, however, Hylians prefer temperate weather and grassy fields, and their towns tend to sprawl across whatever land is available. Hylians are perhaps the most musically inclined of all races, and love a good song. A song tells something about the place it was written, and the person who plays it. Hylians feel that music is a way for the Goddesses of Hyrule to make their will known, and to enact it upon the world. Many of Hyrule’s greatest composers, musicians, and traveling bards, were all Hylian. ",

To a Hylian, fate is not something to be avoided - even a prophecy of doom can be embraced, so long as there’s hope of salvation on the other side. Hylians are quite willing to accept different cultural mores and practices. They’ll dive headfirst into new food, new clothes, and new customs. However, this openness ends where injustice begins: Hylians have a strong sense of right and wrong, and will fight tooth and nail against evil. While not every Hylian is a musician (far from it!), even the most tone-deaf Hylian loves a good song. It’s not uncommon for Hylians to carry a musical instrument, and to use music as a way to pass the time. More skilled Hylian musicians will not only play Magical Songs, but also use melodies to communicate their feelings, offer prayer to the goddesses, or try to build camaraderie. Rather than focusing on a single style of combat, Hylians often carry many different kinds of weapons with them, using different weapons and tactics in different situations. A well-armed Hylian is dangerous more for the breadth of their Spells and Techniques than for their sheer power. Characteristics: Accepting, Courageous, Curious, Honest, Kind, Musical, Pious, Quick-Learning . Hylian Names are varied as Hylians’ homes, but fall into a few patterns: . | Names you or I would find ordinary. | Names based on plants, particularly herbs or crops. | Names based on natural things, like birds, weather, or minerals. Regardless, Hylian names are often spelled in a unique way, to help distinguish them from their source words when written down. | .

    "content": "In some worlds, there may exist a race that appears, at first glance, to be very similar to Hylian children: the Kokiri. Kokiri are forest-children, both metaphorically and literally. They hail from dense, unnavigable forests, and they never age beyond puberty, though they live as long as Hylians do. Kokiri forests are watched over by a guardian spirit of great power, such as the Deku Tree. This spirit keeps evil interlopers out – and keeps the Kokiri in. Those Kokiri who travel the world either escaped from their forest, were sent on a mission by their guardian spirit, or were forced from their home by ill circumstance. Scholars are unsure whether the Kokiri were directly created by that guardian spirit, or were originally Hylian children that the spirit adopted and enchanted. Mechanically, Kokiri are identical to Hylians, with the same Vulnerability and bonuses. ",

    "title": "Injury",
    "content": "By default, Heroes in Reclaim the Wild do not need to worry about long-lasting injury. So long as their HP remains above 0, Heroes are just as capable in their hundredth fight as in their first. In Master Mode, Heroes (and all characters) need to worry about Injuries. Heroes sustain an Injury whenever any of the following occurs: . | They reach 0 Hit Points. | They take damage equal to or greater than 50% of their maximum Hit Points from a single attack. | They enter Peril. | . (Going into Peril can only inflict an Injury once per combat encounter – entering and exiting Peril multiple times in a single battle does not incur multiple Injuries.) . The above ways to gain an Injury may all stack, even within a single attack. For instance, if a foolhardy Hero takes enough damage to go from full health to none in a single blow, they will receive 3 Injuries: one for taking more than half their maximum Hit Points in damage from a single attack, one for entering Peril for the first time in the battle, and another for reaching 0 Hit Points. When a Hero suffers an Injury, they suffer a -1 penalty to all Trait checks in a given Aspect of the Triforce (Power, Wisdom, or Courage). The afflicted Aspect should be chosen randomly with a d6: 1-2 = Power, 3-4 = Wisdom, 5-6 = Courage. However, if the GM and player agree on the Aspect that should be damaged (based on the attack and its description), then they may jointly choose the injured Aspect. There is no limit to the number of Injuries a Hero can have on them at a given time. During an Extended Rest, if a Hero is fed enough to stave off Hunger (or if the Hunger rules, above, are not being used in your game), they may remove one Injury of their choice. Then, a Hero may attempt to have one additional Injury of their choice removed from them by one of the methods below. | Any one person can perform a Nature check on the injured Hero (including the Hero themselves). | OR, the Hero in question can perform a Fortitude check. | . Regardless of the Trait Check attempted, the DC is equal to (10 + (Number of Injuries the Hero has in total)). In addition, a Small Fairy may be used to remove a single Injury from a Hero. This does not have any check – the Small Fairy succeeds automatically. This can be done even if the Hero has already attempted to heal an Injury via one of the above methods. ",

The Legend of Zelda series of video games have been part of the gaming landscape since the beginning of Nintendo’s video gaming consoles. They feature a unique blend of exploration, fantasy, and heroic adventure, which harkens back to the stories of knights and kings battling dragons and demons, rescuing princesses, and saving the world from untimely ends. While the series has been many things over the years, Breath of the Wild (2017) brought the series back to its roots: it allowed players to venture in any direction they choose, and write their own legend in their own way as they sought to save the realm of Hyrule. Reclaim the Wild aims to capture that feeling as well, inspired by the excellence not only of Breath of the Wild, but of all Zelda titles. ",

The Reclaim the Wild Core Rulebook contains all the rules you need to start playing, but how you approach it might depend on your familiarity with Breath of the Wild and with Zelda titles in general. If you are a Zelda fan and a first-time roleplayer, then don’t worry – you’ll fit right in! Tabletop games such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons have enabled people to explore fantasy worlds and tell stories for decades. With this book, some six-sided dice, a group of friends, and your imagination, you’ll soon be crafting your own stories and telling your own tales. You’ll discover new lands and worlds, wield ancient weapons and magical tools, and battle against incredible monsters bent on destruction. If you are new to the world of The Legend of Zelda, you’ll still be able to keep up quite handily. Previous knowledge of the Zelda franchise is certainly helpful, but it is by no means required. Just as every Zelda game is its own unique entity, and does not require knowledge of past games, so too Reclaim the Wild does not require any knowledge of Zelda titles past. Finally, if you have experience with both Zelda games and tabletop roleplaying, then you’ll find this book relatively straightforward. Much as with any RPG rulebook, the rules are introduced in organized sections throughout the book, enabling you to quickly find the rules you need when you need them. Using these rules as a guide, you’ll soon be crafting your own adventures in Hyrule and beyond. ",

This means that many of the features and gameplay mechanics from Breath of the Wild are included in this game, including weapon durability, a reliance on food and raw materials, and a wide variety of Heroes from a plethora of Races. That’s not to say that all other Zelda games were ignored. On the contrary, you’ll find races, items, spells, and numerous nods to nearly every other Zelda game ever created (yes, including the CD-I games).

    "title": "What Makes a Zelda Game?",
    "content": "There have been dozens of Zelda video games, as well as cartoons, manga, novels, and more However, there are some things that are found in nearly every Zelda property, binding them together – and making them all feel like a proper Zelda adventure. Grounded Fantasy . Zelda games feature magic and fantastic creatures, but they remain grounded in reality. For many people, life in Hyrule is much the same as it would be in life on Earth – there are farms to tend to, roads to walk or ride horses on, and tradesmen hand-craft their tools. Their society is on the cusp of a renaissance, with technologies like gun\u0002powder and telescopes available, but not rifles or microscopes. While magic is real, it is also rare, taking significant study or personal talent. There are all the mundane ills and ailments that affect real people, be they physical or personal. However, those ills and ailments are relatively rare, more often than not a symptom of some growing evil that can be battled and s1lain. This is arguably part of the fantasy of Zelda games – that if Heroes rise up and take arms against a single source of evil (and its minions), the world will be a better place. Those Who Came Before . The worlds found in Zelda games often make mention of some ancient civilization that came before the present day. They made powerful weapons and spells with which to fight evil, and then built shrines, temples, or dungeons to hide those artifacts until the day they would be needed again. There were Heroes in the past, as well, who may have wielded those weapons to much the same end that today’s Heroes might. Perhaps they left their techniques to future generations in the form of scrolls, or today’s Heroes might summon their ghosts to ask for vital information. In this way, every Zelda game’s world is built on a foundation of a previous, more powerful civilization – that nonetheless, fell and was forgotten by many. No Hero’s journey is complete without traveling into the depths of a forgotten crypt or ancient temple, seeking the secrets left by those who came before. Humble Beginnings . The typical Zelda game begins with a Hero yet undiscovered. Perhaps they are a simple goat-farmer, or living a quiet life with their uncle; they might be a young forest-boy about to come into adulthood, or the son of a smith, living an unexciting life. Heroes in Zelda games quickly grow beyond these mundane origins, with every feat of heroism bringing them further and further from the ordinary life they started in. However, those beginnings keep the Hero grounded and humble: they know what they’re fighting for, and are rarely tempted to use their newfound power and skill to do more harm than good. Puzzle-Solving Power . While Heroes will grow stronger, smarter, and more skilled as they adventure, Heroes in the Zelda games often find that their power comes not only from the strength of their sword-arm, but also from the plethora of tools that they acquire. Heroes need these tools and the new abilities they confer for more than just efficiently dispatching monsters. They’ll use them to solve puzzles in ancient shrines and lost temples (though in a tabletop game, their own ingenuity can take them much further than in any video game). They’ll also use these items to deal with foes who might otherwise be unstoppable, using a magical tool to uncover a weak point or to turn a monster’s own powers back upon them. Video Game Logic . Zelda games, being video games, operate on a kind of video game logic. Temples are built in strange ways that would annoy any common worshipper, but make them fun to explore – once you’ve found the temple’s special item. Monsters have curious or even nonsensical biology, but those same features make them a joy to fight. While the worlds and the people of Zelda are grounded in a sense of day-to-day reality, when it comes to the fantastical, don’t be afraid to put gameplay first! If it’s more fun, but doesn’t make sense when you think about it later, that is 100% okay. Ancient, Irredeemable Evil . While bandits, brigands, and bad actors might all plague Heroes in a Zelda universe, the primary source of the truly dangerous foes and the ills that plague the land is almost always an ancient, evil force. This force might manifest itself as a powerful wizard, a king of thieves, or a malevolent cloud of death in bestial form. It might corrupt the minds of leaders and those who hold positions of power, or turn the hearts of good people against one another. While there might always have been occasional monsters to threaten the populace, this awakening evil is almost always vastly increasing the number of monsters in the land, making life more dangerous for travelers and villagers alike. Whatever form this evil takes, though, it is always irredeemable – it cannot be talked out of its plans to ruin all that is good and raise itself to prominence. The most Heroes can do with diplomacy is to delay it, while leaving themselves open to a knife in the back. Recurring Elements . Of course, there are many more minor elements that continue to pop up in Zelda game after Zelda game: the Master Sword, fairies, elemental arrows, and marriage-seeking Zora princesses, among others. By using the races, spells, techniques, and items presented in this book, you’ll already be incorporating many of these minor Zelda touchstones in your game. Other recurring elements – tropes, people, and place names in particular – are optional, and vary in their usage from one video game to the next, making them by no means required. ",

    "title": "The Basic of Roleplaying",
    "content": "While roleplaying appears ridiculous and daunting at the outset, with special terms and inscrutable acronyms, the truth is that it’s really quite simple. At its heart, roleplaying is simply “playing pretend”, but with rules – and a Game Master – to help adjudicate situations and lead to further fun and adventure. The Game Master . The Game Master (GM) is the person who creates the adventure. It’s their job to come up with the places, the people, the foes and the challenges that the players will face. The GM also plays the part of all the NPCs (Non-Player Characters) – this includes the monsters they face, the villagers they speak with, the allies they work with, and the villains they seek to thwart. They describe the world to the players, telling them what their characters see, hear, even smell. Finally, the Game Master acts as the game’s referee, interpreting the rules and keeping the Heroes’ journey on track and enjoyable. The Players . Players in Reclaim the Wild each inhabit a Hero, a character of their own design. These Heroes have their own unique histories, traits, and abilities. Their choices determine the direction of the story, having the consequences of their actions – good and bad alike! – described to them by the GM. Often, players will need to have their Heroes cooperate to overcome the challenges that the Game Master sets before them. They’ll also need to use their tools and skills in clever ways, coming up with unexpected solutions to puzzles and battles. Playing the Game . Typically, each session of play begins with the GM setting the scene for the characters, and perhaps with the GM and players jointly recapping the previous session’s events to remind everyone what occurred. The players then take the role of their Heroes, and react to the situation – and the GM, in turn, reacts back, as the NPCs or obstacles that the Heroes are dealing with. When the players attempt to complete a task that has risk or a real possibility of failure, the GM can call for the player(s) to make a Trait Check of an appropriate Trait. The more skilled the Hero is at that Trait, the more likely they are to succeed at the task. When things come to blows, the GM and players enter combat. The players control their Heroes, while the GM controls all the foes and traps that the Heroes are battling. Combat proceeds turn by turn until one side (usually the Heroes) wins. Adventures and Campaigns . When you play Reclaim the Wild, as with any tabletop system, there are individual adventures, which are strung together into an overarching campaign. Adventures are single quests, and typically take only a few sessions of play (or perhaps just one session!) to accomplish from start to finish. These quests should have a clear ‘end’ that the Heroes are striving for: slay the great monster, clear the road of bandits, or deliver a package from the capital city to a small village in the sticks. The Heroes typically have some direct stake in the adventure, or have a reason to see it through. Once complete, the Heroes take their hard-earned rewards, including any Tokens of Heroism they might have earned. Campaigns are a larger structure, made of multiple adventures. Taken together, those adventures form a longer tale, a chronicle the Heroes’ travails from one quest to the next. While an adventure has a clear beginning, middle, and end, campaigns may move from one adventure to the next, as the Heroes work on their long-term objectives (like dethroning an evil king, rebuilding a town, or saving the world). Those long-term goals might shift or change as new information comes to light, new objectives become clear, or the players get distracted and change their minds. Most Zelda games feature both adventures, and a full campaign: while the game as a whole would qualify as a campaign, the individual quests or objectives that Link works through would each be an adventure in their own right.

Creatures of Limited intelligence may use Reactions in combat, but will typically use them at the first available opportunity, which may leave them vulnerable to attacks later in the round. They rarely seek out new items (and only if doing so provides an obvious, self-evident advantage), and they may need training from a Rational creature to use them. Limited creatures will change strategy if their master commands it, or if circumstances strongly suggest it’s a good idea.

Heroes in Total Darkness are Blind, making combat and navigation exceptionally difficult. Caves and dungeons with no light-sources, as well as moonless nights, are oft in Total Darkness. Dim Light provides enough illumination to navigate and fight without issue, but not enough to read by. Some dungeons are bathed in dim light, thanks to thin cracks in the stones or the occasional glowing moss. A moonlit night, a candlelit sanctum, a gently glowing artefact, or a simple campfire all provide Dim Light. Fair Light is bright enough to get things done, without squinting or shielding one’s eyes. Well-lit taverns, a daytime stroll, or the crackling glow of a Torch are all Fair Light. Bright Light is too bright to see by; details are washed out, and you have to squint to focus on things. While in Bright Light, most Heroes are Dazzled. Staring directly into the sun or at a flash of lightning are examples of Bright Light, as are spotlights, flashbangs, or other forms of focused, concentrated light. Of course, light sources can be combined to further increase their brightness. Just two sources of Dim Light working together will make the light Fair, but it takes four sources of overlapping Fair Light make a Bright Light. ",

As such, Songs cannot be purchased from shops or forged from metal and monster parts. Rather, they are given to Heroes as rewards, for tasks both great and small.

    "content": "Songs that are marked as “Composable” can be created by Heroes. These songs typically focus on a single person, place, or thing, and can be learned multiple times, each focusing on a different subject. To compose a Composable song, the Hero must spend a full day (dawn to dusk) focusing on, and in the company of, the subject of their new Song. If the new Song focuses on a place, then the composer must spend their time in that place, undisturbed by combat or adventure. If it focuses on a person, they must spend their time with that person, and that person must willingly allow the Hero to do so. If it focuses on an object, the composer must examine, touch, and observe the object. Composing a Song also consumes a certain amount of Materials, as measured by their Market Price: Minor Songs require 600 Rupees’ worth of Materials, while Major Songs require 1,200 Rupees’ worth. These may be any kind of Materials, of any Rank. (With GM permission, you may also directly use Rupees themselves.) You may also consume any Empty Books or Ink and Quill sets, at their Market price, to pay this cost. The Materials are consumed as part of whatever Song-making process your Hero goes through – be it studious work, religious rituals, magical incantations, scientific experimentation, or other efforts. See the below table for a quick reference of how many Materials of a given Rank it takes to Compose a Minor or Major Song. | Mat.

    "content": "Song of Awakening . Minor . When you play this song, all sleeping creatures that can hear it are awoken the moment the song ends. This automatically succeeds against any mundane slumber, no matter how tired the target might be. Against magically-induced slumber, you must make a Musical Power check against the curse\u0002casting creature’s Arcana; you awaken the target only if you succeed – and even then, you might only temporarily rouse them before the magical slumber claims them again. Song of Birds . Minor . When you play this song, you catch the attention of all birds in the area. This song does not alter their disposition towards you – if a bird does not like you before the song, it will not like you after. Most birds that are neutrally or positively disposed towards you will stop and pay attention to you. This allows you to pick them up and gently manipulate them, making this a prime opportunity to befriend the bird and make it a Companion, if that is your aim. If you attempt to hurt the bird, it will escape your grasp and fly off – and may become negatively disposed to you. If a bird was (or becomes) negatively disposed towards you, it may attack immediately following the end of the song. Any such angry birds will prefer to attack the song’s performer, if possible. If a bird was (or becomes) positively disposed to you, you may give it a simple command that it will follow to the best of its ability, based on your Perform Trait, from the list below. After performing the task, the bird will fly away and resume its normal life. Musical Power 0 – Perform Trick: The bird immediately performs a simple trick, much like a pet would. Musical Power 2 – Carry Message: The bird can carry a letter or other written message to a location within a day’s flight from its current location. Musical Power 4 – Act as Guide: The bird can guide you to a specific place you can name or describe, within a day’s flight from its current location. Musical Power 6 – Fetch the Shiny: The bird can attempt to seek out, pick up, and return to you, with an item you can name within a day’s flight. The item must be unsecured and not inside a building or any kind of bag or container, and must be small and light enough for the bird to pick up. Musical Power 8 – Extended Task: The bird can perform a task over the course of a full day, such as keeping watch over your camp. Song of Blooming . Minor . Upon completion of the song, you cause all plant-based outdoor terrain within (Musical Power) squares of you to bloom with new growth, becoming difficult terrain. In addition, the song causes crops, fungi, and fruit-bearing plants within range to yield food. When harvesting Food Ingredients, add (Musical Power) to the harvest roll. Command Melody . Major . When you play this song, select one inanimate object or willing creature that you can see. For the next hour, you control it. The size of the inanimate object or creature you can control depends on your Perform skill. By default, you can control creatures or objects of Small size or smaller. For every 2 Musical Power, you can control a statue or creature of one Size Category larger. | Musical Power | Statue Size | . | 0 | Small | . | 2 | Medium | . | 4 | Large | . | 6 | Huge | . | 8 | Gigantic | . | 10 | Colossal | . While controlling an object or creature, you must use your actions to make it move and act, much as if it were a Companion. If you control an inanimate object, the object can animate by using any obvious joints, but does not gain any additional powers or durability. If the object does not have any suitable legs, it can still hop along awkwardly (treating all terrain as difficult terrain). You can see through any obvious eyes on the object, or use any other senses that a creature of its shape or description would obviously have – for instance, if you took control of a wolf statue, you might be able to detect scents you otherwise could not. The statue uses your Musical Power in place of Accuracy, Agility, Athletics, Combat, and Willpower. Typically, Statues have Health equal to ((Rank+1) x 10), Defense and Traits of (Rank x 2), and Guard Stats of (10 + (Rank x 2)), based on the Rank of the Materials they are made out of. You may use any weapons the statue obviously has (such as a stone sword, or a mouth with which to bite); treat these as weapons of the same Rank as the Statue. The Rito wizard Mazili is in an ancient tomb, and finds a Marble (Rank 4) statue of some long-forgotten knight, standing next to a heavy door that she cannot open. She plays the Command Melody, and takes control of the statue. As her Musical Power is 6, she can control a person-sized statue with ease, and it has an Athletics of 6 to match her Musical Power. She tells the statue to shove open the heavy doors – and a fireball trap springs! The statue has a Defense of 8, and Health of 50; more than capable of taking the fireball’s damage, and surviving. If you control a willing creature, you can use that creature’s abilities, equipment, Feats, Traits, Spells, and Techniques. You sense everything the creature does, using all of its senses. The creature’s original mind is still present, and may communicate with you while you possess it. It also senses and remembers everything occurring around it. The creature can end your control of it at any time, for any reason. If the creature ever reaches 0 Health, your control over it ends. Song of Communication . Minor, Composable . When learning this song, select a specific sentient being (such as a learned scholar, a Sage, or a dragon). Give this song a new name, signifying the target creature. When played, the caster can communicate verbally with the song’s specified being, as if they were adjacent to the caster; both sides can hear anything that the other party can hear. The song does not provide any visual of the target, or any information about their current whereabouts, and does not allow the two parties to transfer items to one another or to cast magic on one another: it is, essentially, a phone call. The conversation may last for as long as both parties like, up until the next Extended Rest. Either party may end the conversation at will. However, a given creature may only be party to a single Song of Communication at a time; if contacted by another caster’s Song, the target may choose whether to end their current communication or ignore the incoming one. Song of Companions . Major . When played, the caster and any allies near them may designate up to (Musical Power) Companions in total. Those designated Companions will then appear over the nearest ridge, just around the corner, or from behind some convenient obstacle, as if they had already been on their way, and merely happened to arrive just as the song finished. The Companions designated in this song must already be registered to that Hero at a Stable, or have sworn their service to either the caster or one of their nearby allies. The Companions must themselves not have been in danger at the time, such as being in the midst of a battle, a cell in a prison, or in a particularly high-stakes card game. This song only works if the Companions in question could theoretically have safely travelled to the caster on their own, given infinite time: you can use the Song of Companions to call a favorite horse from halfway across a continent, but not to call it to a kingdom of floating clouds, or across the sea, where it could never walk to in a million years. Similarly, this song only works across Worlds if the Companions in question have their own way to travel between Worlds. If no Companions designated in the casting can reach the caster, then the song fails, and the Song is not expended. Melody of Darkness . Major . When you play this Song, you create a zone of painful darkness around you, in a Burst of (Musical Power x 3). While in this zone, creatures are Distracted by you, and take (Musical Power / 2) damage whenever they enter or begin their turn in the zone. Evil or undead creatures are immune. You, your friends, and your companions are also immune, even if you aren’t evil or undead. This Song’s effect does not begin until after you have played it through entirely (taking about five minutes). Once you’ve done so, you can continue to play this Song for as long as you like; otherwise, the Song ends at the end of your turn. While continuing to play this Song, you cannot take Standard Actions, and move as though Slowed. Song of Discovery . Minor . When you perform this song, the location of secrets within (Musical Power) squares are revealed to you. Any objects that are hidden, locked away, buried, or invisible will glow to the caster’s eye, even if behind solid stone. This song does not reveal what the hidden things are, nor how to get to them; just that there is something hidden or secret in that space. For example, if the object is in a safe, it will not reveal the combination, just that “there is something in the safe”; if there is a secret door, it will reveal that the door exists, and where in the wall it is, but not how to open it or where it leads. Elegy of Emptiness . Minor . When you finish playing this song, you step forward one square. In the square you left behind, a statue facsimile of you appears. (If you cannot step forward, the song fails.) . The statue facsimile of you is made of stone, is the same size as you, and weighs twice as much as you do. It can be pushed or picked up. At a glance, it appears to look like you, but any close inspection will reveal flaws and inconsistencies that clearly reveal its nature, both as a statue, and as not-quite-like-you. To discern the difference, the observer must roll Perception v. (your Musical Power x 2). You may only have (Musical Power / 2) statues of yourself active at any one time. When you play this song again while at that limit, select one already-existing statue of you to make disappear. All statues created with this song disappear at the end of your next Extended Rest. Farore’s Wind . Minor . The first time Farore’s Wind is played, the user marks their present location with a beacon of green Dim Light. The beacon hangs in the air for a moment, and then fades from view. If the user attempts to mark a location that is not safe or stationary, the song fails, and the original marked location (if there is one) remains marked. On subsequent playings, the user may choose to either change the location they have marked previously, or to transport themselves and up to (Musical Power) other persons with them to their marked location. Future’s Fugue . Major . When you perform this song, you enter a fugue state, where the mists of time envelop you and reveal insights into things that have not yet occurred. While in this fugue state, you may ask up to (Musical Power) questions. These questions must relate to a specific action, event, or goal that has not yet happened, but may not be a question of simple knowledge. For instance, asking “What is the Weak Point of the sorceress Veran?” will get you nothing, but “What will happen if I shoot Veran with a Silver Arrow?” is valid. The answers to your question do not have to be known by any living or dead creature – the Goddess of Time is answering your question, and nothing can hide from her. However, the event in question must be occurring within the next 10 days, or the vagaries of causality will be too vast to make out any information of use. When a question is asked, the performer is treated to a vision of what will happen, or what is most likely to happen. However, even visions of certain doom should not be taken as a guarantee of failure – Heroes, in particular, have a long and storied history of thwarting the inevitable. Once the performer has seen a vision, they may use their remaining questions to ask what might occur if they take a different course of action, or if they change the circumstances of the event. They may also ask to see what caused such an outcome to occur, or ask about a different event entirely. Farewell to Gibdos . Major . While you play this Song, all undead and evil creatures who can hear it are caused pain and annoyance by the song. Other creatures find it to be a jaunty, joyful tune. You create a zone of joyful music around you in a Burst (Musical Power x 3). While in this zone, evil and undead creatures find you Hard to Hit, and take (Musical Power / 2) damage whenever they enter or begin their turn in the zone. They are Slowed if they try to move towards you, but they are free to move away from you. This Song’s effect does not begin until after you have played it through entirely (taking about five minutes). Once you’ve done so, you can continue to play this Song for as long as you like; otherwise, the Song ends at the end of your turn. While continuing to play this Song, you cannot take Standard Actions, and move as though Slowed. Goron Lullaby . Major . When you play this song, all creatures who are awake and can hear the song, excepting yourself and (Musical Power) allies you designate, begin to get drowsy. Roll (2d6 + Perform + Instrument Rank) against each target’s Concentration; on success, they fall asleep, going Prone. Creatures affected by this Song will remain asleep for at least (Musical Power) minutes. However, they can still be woken up by normal means, such as being splashed with cold water or hearing a loud noise. Song of Healing . Major . When you play this song, select a single curse, persistent magical spell, or other negative energy that you stand in the presence of. You attempt to end the effect in question. Make a Musical Power roll. The DC and the effect of your Musical Power roll depends on the exact nature of the curse or spell you’re attempting to end. The number you need to beat might be an Arcana roll from the curse’s original caster, or it might be a static number, based on the strength and complexity of the curse or spell. It’s up to the GM to decide an appropriate DC for this Musical Power roll. If you fail this roll, you still temporarily ease or abate the curse for (Musical Power) minutes. However, after this time, the spell returns to full force. If you succeed the Musical Power roll, you break the curse, end the spell, or quell the negative energy. Depending on the curse or spell, this may have further consequences. Minish Minuet . Minor . When you perform this song, you and up to (Musical Power) compatriots transform from your normal size, to the size of the fabled Minish – for every foot tall you normally are, you are now only an inch tall (1/12th your normal size). While at Minish size, your attacks can only deal 1 damage to normal-sized foes. You may find that things that were non-issues at your normal size – puddles, Critters, the wind – might be terrible obstacles or deadly foes at Minish size. You may also use this song to return to your normal size. This fails if there is not enough room to accommodate you and your compatriots at their normal size. Oath to Order . Major . When you learn this song, it is tied to a single powerful entity or group of entities (such as Farore, Goddess of Courage; the Giants of Terminia; or Eldin, guardian spirit of Eldin Province). It is also tied to at least one specific task, threat, or obstacle that the Divinity will help you overcome, of sufficient importance and difficulty as to warrant divine assistance. When you play this song, that divine entity appears in a dazzling display, and sets about helping you conquer the obstacle, threat, or task that was specified. They may not be able to accomplish the entire task – often, even when the divine steps in, there is still call for Heroes – but the divine entity will do the best they can to ease the Heroes’ burdens and open a path to victory. If played without need, or without profit to the divine entity, they may take the false summons poorly. Beware the story of the boy who cried Wolfos. This song may be learned multiple times, each time targeting a different divine entity. If a divine entity wishes to pledge its help to more than one task, threat, or obstacle, it does not need to teach a separate song for the different tasks – the divine entity may expand the scope of the song’s designated tasks, but it cannot renege on promises already made. Song of Return . Major, Composable . When learning this song, select a specific location. The location must be generally safe and free from enemies and hazards (though that may not be a guarantee). Give this song a new name, signifying its target location. When played, the performer and up to (Musical Power) creatures, and their possessions, turn into motes of Dim Light, and drift into the breeze. They reappear at the song’s specified location five minutes later, reassembling from motes of light over the course of about fifteen seconds. The caster must be in the same World as the target location for this song to work: if they are not, then the song fails. Heroes may learn multiple versions of this song, each targeting a different location. Royal Password . Minor . When learning this song, it is tied to a single group (such as a particular royal family, merchant house, or secret society). When you play this song, you clearly identify yourself as having the blessing of that group, both to creatures who work with or serve them, and to any doors, objects, or artifacts relating to that group. In short, playing this song at the right place, or for the right people, may open doors for you, both literally and metaphorically. A curious feature of this song is its inimitability: even if one hears it a thousand times, they will not be able to replay it by ear. The song must be specifically taught to you, by someone who knows it and is ‘in the group’. If a person loses the favor of the group the song represents, and the group formally revokes their membership, the offender will be unable to play the song properly – it will be off-key, poorly-timed, and otherwise obviously incorrect. Heroes may learn multiple versions of this song, each representing a different group. Song of Soul . Minor . When you play this song near a deceased body, the body’s soul returns to its corpse. The soul is bound to the corpse for an amount of time based on your Musical Power. After the time expires, the soul automatically leaves its body. The corpse’s capabilities depend on just how old it is, how well preserved, and how much of it is left – the Song of Soul does not heal or restore the corpse in any way. If the corpse still has muscle, it can move (and fight) as it did in life; if it’s not well\u0002preserved, it may have less Health than when it was alive; if it lacks a head, the corpse will not be able to navigate very well, lacking eyes. The sole exception is the ability to speak: so long as there is at least a skull, the soul within will be able to speak aloud. | Musical Power | Time Granted | . | 1 | 1 minute | . | 2 | 10 minutes | . | 3 | 30 minutes | . | 4 | 1 hour | . | 5 | 2 hours | . | 6 | 4 hours | . | 7 | 8 hours | . | 8 | 12 hours | . | 9 | 16 hours | . | 10 | 24 hours | . The Song of Soul does not force the soul to take any actions or to obey any commands – it still has free will, and may need to be cajoled, convinced, or otherwise forced to answer your questions or act on your behalf. Symphony of Sages . Major . When you perform this song, you and your allies gain an audience with an innumerable host of mystic sages, each with a deep knowledge of their favored subject; some may still be living, and others might have passed. The sages appear before you as ghostly figures, unable to physically interact with the world, and will leave if attacked or ignored. You may ask the sages a number of questions equal to (your Perform rank). For the sages to be able to answer a question, the answer must be known by at least one sentient creature, living or dead, who would be willing to share it with your or those allied with you. The sages do not know what will happen in the future, and cannot make predictions any more accurately than a normal, reasonable person could. The sages’ answers may not necessarily be easy to understand, but they will communicate to you in a language you know, and will attempt to make themselves understood – if a sage answers with something vague, it is because they themselves do not know the full answer, or because the vague answer is the most truthful or useful answer. If your campaign has specific sages, or other mystical, scholarly, or powerful beings that the Heroes have met and allied with, you may instead use this song to ‘conference call’ them. In this case, no unknown host of sages appear; only sages you have met and allied with will answer your call, though they may also decline to participate if they are busy or indisposed. This allows Heroes to get specific insights from the sages, and allow them to speak with both yourself, your allies, and one another. Wind’s Requiem . This song can only be played at the end of a Short or Extended Rest. When you play this song, select one of the following results. Minor, Requires Musical Power 3 – You may determine the result of the last Weather Check: whether the weather gets more intense, less intense, or stays at its present intensity. In addition, you may also determine the direction the wind will be blowing, however strong it may be. The wind will continue blowing in this direction until your next Short or Extended Rest. Minor, Requires Musical Power 6 – You may determine the result of the last three Weather Checks: whether the weather gets more intense, less intense, or stays at its present intensity. In addition, you may also determine the direction the wind will be blowing, however strong it may be. The wind will continue blowing in this direction until your next Extended Rest. Major, Requires Musical Power 9 – You may select any Weather type, and any rank of that Weather. Over the next five minutes, the weather changes to match your selection, no matter how wild the change. If you chose a Weather type not normal for this area, then any Weather check that would result in the weather becoming more intense will instead keep it at its present intensity, and any Weather check result that would keep it at the same intensity will instead reduce its intensity. When the weather gets to Rank 0, it returns to the type of weather native to this area. In addition, you may also determine the direction the wind will be blowing, however strong it may be. The wind will continue blowing in this direction until your next Extended Rest. Song of the World . Major . When learning this song, select a specific World (such as “Light World”, “Dark World”, “World of Twilight”, “Subrosia”, etc.). Give this song a new name, signifying that World. When played, the performer and up to (Musical Power) creatures, and their possessions, turn into silhouettes of rainbow colors; the targets see the world change in much the same way. The targets fade from their current World, and fade into being in the song’s target World, at the same physical location. The caster must not be in the same World as the target location for this song to work. The target location must also be free of rock and solid matter in the target world. Otherwise, the song fails, and is not expended. Heroes may learn multiple versions of this song, each time targeting a different World. ",

    "content": "After determining a Monster’s Rank, you next should decide what role they play in a fight. A monster’s role helps define what it does and how it acts, as well as guiding your hand when assigning its Traits and what Spells and Techniques it knows. A monster’s role also serves as a handy way to ensure an interesting combat – typically, a fight is more engaging when it contains foes of at least two or more different roles. Blasters hit multiple foes with their attacks, and try to spread damage across their opponents, making sure to punish any foolish foes who group up and make themselves prime targets. A Blaster is happiest when they score a juicy hit on many foes at once, scattering them to the winds. Hunters tend to hang back, hiding from opponents, and hoping to never meet them face-to-face. Instead, they snipe from afar with long-range weapons or spells, lay traps for unwary fools, or attack from the shadows, all to devastating effect. A Hunter is happiest when they trap or slay a foe, and that foe has no idea who or what took them down. Protectors use their skills, physical prowess, or magic, to keep their enemies away from their allies, and to withstand repeated blows. They put up walls, prevent foes from moving past them, or pull their prey back to their side whenever they get away. A Protector is happiest when a foe is far away from their allies, or at least, right next to themselves. Ralliers manipulate the flow of battle, directing their allies and aiding their efforts. They might heal wounded allies, increase a friend’s prowess in battle, or curse a foe to weaken them. A Rallier is happiest when they aid weak allies, and weaken strong foes. Warriors prize getting into melee with an opponent, and attacking them for all they’re worth. Some Warriors will attempt to dogpile a target, bringing death by a thousand cuts; others are so terrifyingly strong that they can obliterate a foe on their own. A Warrior is happiest when they meet an enemy on the battlefield and cause them pain, punishing them for their impudence. Note that a Monster’s Role doesn’t say anything about how they go about things. For example, one Blaster might use Spells, while another might use Techniques, and a third might use Items, but as long as they’re trying to do damage to many foes at once, they’re all Blasters. These different monster roles can work together in interesting ways, even when the monsters themselves might be very different. For instance, a Blaster and a Protector form a potent combo, where the Blaster fires shots into the Heroes’ party while the Protector keeps those same Heroes from doing anything about it. That same Blaster and a Hunter might work together in a different way, using the Blaster’s attacks to scatter Heroes in the direction of the Hunter’s traps or long-range attacks. ",

That’s enough to keep up with a Hero in a hectic fight, but not quite enough to outrun them over open ground. This also allows Heroes to cleverly place obstacles to keep the foe out of melee range, at least for a time. (Remember that Heroes, by default, have 6 Movement.) .

Heroes may want to befriend animals, tame mounts, and even gain squires. This is only natural! While any living creature can be made a Hero’s Companion, doing so requires effort – and keeping them alive in a fight may require careful strategy. However, the benefits may be numerous. A Hero may be powerful, but they are still limited – only able to carry so many things, know so much lore, perform so many deeds. While Companions are almost always less powerful than a Hero, they can still aid their patron Hero and their allies in ways both mundane and arcane. Heroes may also have temporary Companions: the knight pressed into following the Heroes, and keeping an eye on their activities; the traveler who wishes safe passage, and is willing to help the Heroes who are helping her; the noble prince, rescued from the tower, now trying to keep up and show that he’s more than dead weight. While they may not follow a Hero’s every order or have sworn an oath to them, these temporary followers may still need to fall under this umbrella if they journey with the Heroes for a long enough time.

    "content": "Heroes can only attempt to gain Companions that meet the following criteria: . | The target Companion-to-be must be alive, and able to hear or see the Hero. | The target must not be currently actively hostile to the Hero. (You cannot attempt to gain a Companion mid-fight.) | The target and the Hero have interacted for a while (at least an hour, if not more). | . When presented with the opportunity for a Hero to gain a Companion, there are two ways a GM might resolve the situation: through roleplay, or roll-play. In roleplaying the situation, the Hero(es) ask the potential Companion (played by the GM) to join them. They might attempt to befriend them, learn more about their motivations or their troubles, or discuss what makes them more alike than different. When roll-playing the situation, it all comes down to a die roll. The Hero must make a Command check, with a DC equal to (10 + (Target’s Rank x 3)). That roll is modified by the Hero’s actions towards the target in the past, and the target’s circumstances. Regardless of how the situation is resolved, if the Hero succeeds – and both the GM and the Player feel it appropriate – then the would-be Companion is persuaded to join. Roleplaying the gaining of a Companion is suggested for sentient or near-sentient companions, like kids, lesser adventurers, or (perhaps) whip-smart animals. Roll-playing is better suited for monstrous, animalistic, or very simple creatures – or simply if the GM and players both prefer to leave it to a Trait check, rather than their roleplaying ability. | Circumstance | Modifier | . | Target is sentient (human or greater intelligence) | -2 | . | Target has many others it can depend on (a loving family, a powerful tribe, etc.) | -2 | . | You have made a small effort to hinder them (teased, annoyed, or delayed them, etc.) | -2 | . | You have made a major effort to hinder them (worked to foil their plans, stolen from them, etc.) | -4 | . | Target has other obligations (has sworn service to another person, is serving in an army, etc.) | -4 | . | The target has tried to include you in their customs, and you have spurned or insulted them | -4 | . | Circumstance | Modifier | . | Target is young or impressionable | -2 | . | Target shares significant common ground with you (similar upbringing, a major shared experience, a common foe) | -2 | . | You have made a small effort to help them (fed them, spoken kindly to them, etc.) | -2 | . | You have made a major effort to help them (fed them your last ration, risked your life for them) | -4 | . | Target does not have others it can depend on (is an orphan, has travelled from far away, etc.) | -4 | . | The target has included you in their customs, and you have embraced and respected them. | -4 | . Many other factors might come into play; the GM is free to add modifiers based on the target’s past experience, recent events, and the Hero’s own actions. If the Hero fails the recruitment check, the target is unconvinced. They may run away, retaliate, or they may simply stay put, curious, and allow the Hero to try again. However, Heroes may only try to recruit a given target once per day. Once a Companion accepts the Hero, they will follow the Hero as best as they can. However, if the Hero then tames another Companion, the first Companion may simply stay put where they are, or wander off on their own accord, based on the Companion’s temperament and circumstances. Companions are just like the monsters that Heroes fight on a day-to-day basis, right down to their stats. When a Hero tames a Companion, they retain all their Traits, Techniques, Spells, Feats, gear, and so on. ",

Animal companions are cared for, and sometimes put to work – horses might pull plows, dogs might herd sheep, and so forth. Sentient Companions are also put to menial work, but that may include singing songs and telling stories for other workers, being look-outs for trouble, or working as a bouncer against rowdy guests. For people on the run, or in the employ of great Heroes, staying at the Stable serves as a tradition – a time of relative peace, to gather one’s thoughts and stretch one’s legs.

    "content": "Normally, weapons cannot be repaired or reforged: attempting to do so creates subtle imperfections in a weapon, rendering it useless for all but display. Natural Weapons, or weapons with a Weapon Spirit, can heal those – and even be improved further. Repairing or Upgrading such a weapon requires access to a Forge and sufficient Smithing skill, much like crafting a new weapon would. Natural Weapons may only be upgraded to a Rank of ((wielder’s base Discipline + Fortitude) / 3). | Discipline+ Fortitude | Max. NaturalWeapon Rank | . | 2 | 1 | . | 5 | 2 | . | 8 | 3 | . | 11 | 4 | . | 14 | 5 | . Natural Weapons use Monster Parts, while Spirit-infused weapons use either the weapon’s Material type, or Ancient Materials. To repair a weapon, simply consume one Material of the weapon’s Rank or higher. This restores (Material’s Rank + 1) Durability to the weapon. So, using some Dark Ore (Rank 4 Metal) to repair a Rank 3 weapon would restore 5 Durability. You may do this multiple times, allowing you to fully restore a repairable weapon’s Durability without waiting for it to regenerate naturally. To upgrade a weapon, you must apply 4 Materials, of the next Rank up. If you use Ancient Material to reforge a Spirit-infused weapon, it becomes an Ancient weapon. Once done, the weapon is increased to the next Rank, and is restored to full Durability. You may also apply a Crafting Style as part of this process (overwriting the weapon’s existing Crafting Style, if it has one). Be sure to modify the amount of Materials used based on the new Crafting Style, if needed. A weapon can only be upgraded one step at a time. To bring a weapon from Rank 3 to Rank 5, for instance, it must first be brought to Rank 4, and only then to Rank 5. If the weapon is already Enchanted (beyond the Enchantment provided by a Weapon Spirit), the Enchantment remains at its current Rank. The Enchantment provided by a Weapon Spirit is automatically increased to the weapon’s new Rank. To change a repairable weapon’s (non-Spirit) Enchantment, you may simply re\u0002enchant it, as if it were without an enchantment. This overwrites the previous Enchantment. However, you cannot change the Enchantment a Weapon Spirit provides. ",

The “Sell to a merchant” price represents the typical price a merchant will pay a typical Hero for the item, before the Hero attempts to do any haggling.

It represents how the Hero presents themselves to a merchant, and the merchant’s first impression of the Hero. Passive Haggling is based on a Hero’s Influence, minus the Merchant’s Discipline.

They may be looking to buy a high-value item, trying to negotiate a bulk price on a large shipment of goods, or simply want to press their luck. In these cases, Heroes use Active Haggling. When a Hero haggles with a Merchant, they make a contested Trait Check of Influence vs. the Merchant’s Discipline. Once you’ve decided to use Active Haggling, though, there’s no going back – even if you get a worse deal than if you had stuck with Passive Haggling. If a Hero succeeds, they decrease the price of purchased items by 10% of Market Price, or increase the value of their sales to a Merchant by 5% of Market Price. If they lose, however, the reverse happens – they get a worse deal than if they had simply used Passive Haggling. In all cases, a good’s value is capped by the Market Price. Merchants will never sell for less, or buy for more, than an item’s Market Price. When Heroes go to haggle, they and the GM can decide whether they haggle per individual item, or only roll to haggle once, and have that result apply to all the prices in their current visit. It’s recommended to do the former if you’re buying a small number of high-priced items (such as weapons or armor), and to do the latter if you’re trading for a large number of similar items (such as Tools and Materials). | Hero beats Merchant by… | Sell to Vendor… | Buy from Vendor markup… | . | 0 or less | 50% | 200% | . | 1 | 55% | 190% | . | 2 | 60% | 180% | . | 3 | 65% | 170% | . | 4 | 70% | 160% | . | 5 | 75% | 150% | . | 6 | 80% | 140% | . | 7 | 85% | 130% | . | 8 | 90% | 120% | . | 9 | 95% | 110% | . | 10 or More | (Market Price) 100% | (Market Price) 100% | .

However, some people find that having their weapons gradually degrade, and eventually break apart in their hands, is unsatisfying. They may wish to enjoy their weapons forever, without having to worry about finding, buying, or crafting new ones to replace them. On the other hand, the GM may want to run their game more like a traditional fantasy tabletop game, where crafting and resource gathering take a back seat to adventure and derring-do. Alternatively, a particular mundane weapon may be important to the campaign’s plot or to a Hero’s character. Perhaps a weapon was gifted to a Hero by their dying father, or is proof of a lost prince’s lineage. Even though these weapons do not have a Weapon Spirit in them, the GM may decide to allow them to be repaired and reforged, without allowing all mundane weapons the same treatment. This should only be done on a case-by-case basis, after discussion with all players – if one player has access to a repairable weapon, other players may see it as an unfair advantage. Thus, for those people who prefer their weapons never break, for whatever reason, we present the below rules: .

Be sure to specify whether this applies to all mundane weapons, or solely those few that the GM deems as particularly important or deserving. If all mundane weapons can be repaired and upgraded (and not just a rare few weapons that are important to a character or to the plot), the GM should reduce the Materials gained from Monsters or resources by 1. Because crafting and weapon scarcity are integral to a lot of the systems and design balance in Reclaim the Wild, it is unadvisable to remove durability from the game entirely. ",

Rito are lanky humanoid birds, with wings for arms and beaks for mouths. Their featherscan be any one color or combination of colors. The tips of their wings are typically white, and those feathers are dexterous and strong enough to serve as broad fingers. Their legs are those of a bird: two sharp talons face forward; one faces backwards. Their eyes are similar to those of Hylians, sharing the same hues and general shape. Rito towns are typically situated in remote, mountainous places, surrounded by valleys – the perfect lookout to see all land-dwelling visitors from miles off. Despite their remote, inaccessible locations, Rito towns still maintain contact with the outside world – their citizens have no trouble traveling hither and yon, and the occasional adventurous soul still manages to climb many a Rito town’s crags in order to visit.

    "content": "Rito respect skill above all else. It matters little what the skill actually is, so long as one strives for excellence. Some Rito are self-important, caught up in their own peerless prowess; many others can still be respectful, helping others to rise to a challenge. When interacting with others, Rito tend to seek the high ground, both literally (preferring to perch above someone’s sightline, if possible) and metaphorically. When someone concedes a point to a Rito in an argument, they will gladly seize upon that and try to press further. Because of this, Rito have a reputation among other races for being haughty or conceited. If a Rito is the best at something, or knows something that another wishes to know, they rarely shy away from making that fact known. However, the reverse is also true - if someone impresses them with a skill that exceeds their own, most Rito won’t hide their appreciation (however they choose to express it). Because of this, Rito also have a reputation as excellent teachers and storytellers. Rito take pride in archery, finding it most useful when they take to the air, though no technique is beneath the effort it takes to master it. Since their main asset in battle is flight, Rito warriors and wizards will often look to ways to utilize it to the utmost, staying out of range of foes while in the air – or swooping in to attack foes at the rear. Characteristics: Boastful, Conceited, Haughty, Instructor, Proud, Skillful, Storied, Traveled . Rito Names usually end in vowel sounds, and avoid hard consonants (except for the letter ‘G’, which is always pronounced hard).

Rito architecture favors wide, open spaces, resembling a gazebo more than anything else. Their homes have few walls or doors, and lots of openings into the great outdoors. This allows them to quickly exit a room and take flight. Rito tend to fare poorly when in closed, cramped environs, like caves or tight corridors. While some races might call this claustrophobia, the Rito would call it a rational fear - Rito see their power of flight as their greatest strength over others, and when it is nullified, they get justifiably concerned. If given the chance, Rito will fully use whatever vertical space is available to them, preferring to be up high whenever possible. Rito might perch on top of a bookcase or the back of a chair when having a conversation, or they might prefer to sit on the roof of a house instead of on the porch. For a Rito, claiming the high ground is a simple, unconscious instinct. ",

When it comes time for Heroes to test their skills, the GM first decides how difficult the task will be, selecting a Difficulty Check (DC) based on the chart below. Then, the Hero(es) in question roll 2d6, plus the relevant Trait, plus or minus any modifiers. They then compare that number to the challenge’s DC: if the roll meets or exceeds the DC, then they succeed; otherwise, they fail. Some Trait checks are opposed rolls: a Hero rolls against another creature, who is also rolling a Trait. In these cases, the two creatures involved in the check roll at the same time, and compare their results. In an opposed Trait check, the creature with the higher number wins. Ties go to the ‘aggressor’ – the one who initiated the check. For instance, if you face a challenge with a DC of 10, and you roll a 10, then you succeed – albeit, barely. A roll of 1 on each die is not an automatic failure, but can certainly be played up for laughs. It should not cause additional pain and suffering beyond failure, though. Similarly, rolling two 6’s is not an automatic success, but can be played up as a moment of epic, astounding competence. ",

They are smooth to the touch, and shaped like elongated hexagons. When tapped against another Rupee, they make a pleasing chime. Quite literally, they are music to a merchant’s ears. An individual Rupee’s value is based on its color. In general, the rarer that color is, the more valuable the Rupee.

Heroes have found puzzles in tombs that require them to pick up specific Rupees found in hard-to\u0002reach spots, rewarding them with both spending cash and progress through the dungeon. They have also found Rupoors, blackened corruptions of Rupees that magically remove money from one’s wallet when touched, before disappearing in a puff of spite.

Sheikah tend to be observant, watching both their foes and their friends for weaknesses – either to exploit them, or to shore them up.

During a Short Rest, Heroes can eat a Dish to restore their Health, Stamina, or Magic, but do not have enough time to sleep to restore their resources naturally. Short Rests are typically just the Heroes taking a moment to rest, eat a meal, chit-chat between one another, or just stretch their muscles, before setting out on adventure again. Extended Rests range from four hours to an entire day, typically lasting about 8 hours. During an Extended Rest, Heroes can eat a Dish to restore their Health, Stamina, or Magic, but can also sleep to restore their resources further. Extended Rests are typically the Heroes bedding down for the night, or taking a day off to take care of errands or visit with NPC friends. In both Short and Extended Rests, Heroes may take the time to craft, as their Materials, available Tools, and circumstances allow. If the Heroes are resting in a town or other settlement, they may use the services there to their fullest while resting – IE, they may use the town’s Forge and peruse the shops, even if they are rooming at the town’s Inn. During either Short or Extended Rests, if the Heroes are resting in a place that has obvious scavenging opportunities, they may also scavenge for materials – for instance, if the Heroes are resting in a field of flowers, then they may scavenge those flowers. However, they may not venture far from camp to scavenge (at that point, you’re simply adventuring again).

While any Weapon can be used for spells, when you use a Wizardly weapon (like a Rod or Staff) to cast a Spell, your Willpower is increased by (Weapon’s Rank / 2) for __all__ purposes of the Spell. Casting a Spell while making use of this bonus counts as successfully using that weapon, for the purposes of calculating Durability damage at the end of a fight. When a Spell says its cost is (Willpower) Magic, you may choose to spend less than that, resulting in a less powerful spell. (All Spells with a cost based on the caster’s Willpower have at least one effect that is based on the Magic spent on the spell.) . Bari’s Coat . 3 Tokens Cost: 6 Magic (Bind) **Range: Self Minor Action **Effect: You are Electrified. If a foe takes damage from striking you with a metallic weapon while you are Electrified, you may perform the following Reaction: Burn the Magic Bound in this spell (ending the Electrified status) to immediately attempt a Disarm Maneuver against the foe. This Disarm attempt must target the metallic weapon that struck you. Bellum’s Consumption . 6 Tokens Cost: 5 Magic Range: Melee Damage: Weapon + Willpower, Dark Effect: You gain (Willpower / 4) Temporary Hit Points. Blizzagia’s Breath . 6 Tokens Cost: 5 Magic (Bind) Range: Blast 3 Effect: The squares turn to Slick Ice.

Camera . 3 Tokens Cost: 2 Magic (Bind) Range: Your current field of vision Effect: You may perfectly remember what you are looking at in this exact moment – well enough to read written words, or produce a high-quality reproduction by sketch. This does not provide you with details that you could not see at the time, nor any capacity to ‘zoom in’ on the mental picture. When the spell ends, your perfect recall of what you saw also ends, though you may remember it normally. Chilfos’ Javelin . 3 Tokens Cost: 3 Magic Range: Projectile 8 Damage: Weapon + Willpower, Ice . Create Ammunition, Lesser . 3 Tokens Cost: 1 Magic (Burn) Use Requirement: At least one empty hand, or space in your inventory. Range: Self Effect: Select either an Arrow or a Bomb. When you cast this spell, a single unit of that ammunition appears in your hand, ready to be used. (If your hand is not empty, the ammunition appears in your inventory.) The ammunition is ephemeral, and obviously both magical and temporary to anyone who observes or handles it. This may only create normal Bombs and Arrows. Ammunition made with this spell cannot be used in crafting. The ammunition in question lasts until your next Short or Extended Rest. Create Ammunition, Greater . 6 Tokens Learn Requirement: Create Ammunition, Lesser Cost: 2 Magic (Burn) Use Requirement: At least one empty hand, or space in your inventory. Range: Self Effect: Select either a type of Arrow or a type of Bomb, worth no more than 50 Rupees. When you cast this spell, a single unit of that ammunition appears in your hand, ready to be used. (If your hand is not empty, the ammunition appears in your inventory.) The ammunition is ephemeral, and obviously both magical and temporary to anyone who observes or handles it. Ammunition made with this spell cannot be used in crafting. The ammunition in question lasts until your next Short or Extended Rest. Cryonis . 3 Tokens Cost: 1 Magic per square (Bind) Range: Up to (Willpower / 2) water squares within 8 squares Effect: Each square of water freezes into a 2-square tall, 1-square wide block of solid ice. Any creatures or objects in the square are raised by the freezing ice, and end up on top of the block. This ice can be climbed and stood on. No matter where it was formed, the block will stay put, and cannot be moved by natural means. During their turn as a Free Action, the caster may dismiss the block(s), returning the bound Magic. A block is destroyed by any attack that damages it, Spending the Magic. You may have up to (Willpower) total Magic Bound in this spell. Dark Brambles . 3 Tokens Cost: 1 Magic per 2 squares (Bind), rounded up Range: (Willpower) unoccupied squares within 8 squares Effect: A tangle of thorned vines sprout from the ground. Brambles are 1 square wide and 1 square tall, and count as Difficult Terrain. Dark Brambles are thick enough to count as cover against Ranged attacks, but do not utterly block line of sight. Brambles must be placed on a solid surface, or next to (or atop) other brambles. Anyone starting their turn in, or entering, a square of brambles takes 1 damage, ignoring Defense. During your turn as a Free Action, you may dismiss all of your brambles, returning the Bound Magic (round down). Brambles can be destroyed by any Light or Sharp attack. If struck with Fire, the brambles transform into Brushfire terrain, and the bound Magic is Spent (round up, up to the Magic Bound). Daruk’s Protection . 6 Tokens Cost: 10 Magic Use Requirement: You or an ally within range is hit by an attack Range: 1 target within 8 squares Reaction Effect: The target suffers 50% less damage from the attack.

Impa’s Disguise . 3 Tokens Cost: 2 Magic (Bind) Range: Self Effect: You alter details about your appearance as you see fit, up to and including your race, gender, and worn armor. (Your weapons’ appearances are not altered.) This spell does not alter the smell, sound, or tactile feeling of your person or weapons, and cannot change your visible size category. When you make Guile checks related to this disguise, the spell grants you a +2 Spell Bonus to the check. The effect persists even through Short or Extended Rests, so long as you keep the Magic cost bound. This disguise can be seen through with the Lens of Truth spell. Jabu-Jabu’s Switchhook . 9 Tokens Learn Requirement: Ravio’s Hookshot Cost: 12 Magic Use Requirement: You and the target are not in mid-air or in damaging terrain. Range: Projectile 8 Effect: You switch places with the target. Korok Leaf’s Wind . 3 Tokens Cost: Up to (Willpower) Magic Range: Line (Magic spent on spell) Effect: You create a gust of wind, blowing in the direction you are facing. The wind lasts only for a few seconds, but is strong enough to propel a small sailing-raft, knock apples out of trees, fan flames, or otherwise affect the environment. It will also push creatures 2 squares along the spell’s Line, unless they are secured, Halted, very heavy, or otherwise immovable. Keeta’s Touch . 3 Tokens Cost: 4 Magic Range: Melee Damage: Weapon + Willpower, Earth Effect: Roll To-Hit target’s Vitality; on success, one of the target’s currently-equipped weapons is Rusted.

Kyameron’s Splash . 3 Tokens Cost: 6 Magic Range: Projectile 8 Damage: Weapon + Willpower, Water Effect: The Projectile from this Spell may bounce off of a single wall, solid object, or other creature, but may only move 8 squares in total. (If it bounces off of a creature, that creature is also considered a target of this spell.) Roll To-Hit target’s Vitality; on success, the target is Soaked. Lana’s Lightning Block . 9 Tokens Learn Requirement: One other Spell that does Shock-type damage Cost: 12 Magic (Bind) Range: 1 square within 8 squares Effect: The air solidifies into a 2-square tall, 1-square wide block of solid lightning. This block can be pushed, climbed or stood on, but only by its caster. It is immobile and intangible to all others. Any creature entering or starting their turn in the block’s space takes (your Willpower) Shock damage. A block can be destroyed by its caster as a Minor Action. This causes the block to implode, Spending the Magic, and dealing (Weapon + (3 x Willpower)) Shock damage to any creature inside it. The caster may dismiss the block as a Free Action, returning the bound Magic. You may have only one Lightning Block up at a time. Lanmola’s Stonespray . 6 Tokens Cost: 8 Magic Range: Projectile 8 Damage: Weapon + Willpower, Earth Effect: Roll To-Hit target’s Vitality; on success, all targets within 1 square of the original target are struck for (Weapon + Willpower), Earth damage.

This spell does not reveal the truth behind non-magical deceptions. When you cast this spell, you may make a Perception check on a target you can see as a follow-up Free Action (including targets you could not see before casting the spell). While active, you may re-cast this spell as a Free Action. Magnesis . 3 Tokens Cost: 4 Magic Range: 1 metallic target within 8 squares Effect: You may move a single metallic creature or object in a direction you choose: up, down, side to side, towards or away from you. The object must stay within the spell’s range, or it immediately falls to the ground. Your magnetic grip on the object lasts until the start of your next turn; you may then re-cast Magnesis again to keep your magnetic grip uninterrupted. To determine how heavy an object you can move, calculate your 2h Lifting capacity, using Willpower instead of Athletics. If the object’s weight is less than your “2h Burdened” weight, you may move it up to 3 squares; if it’s less than your “2h Easy” weight, you may move it up to 6 squares. Magnesis is a spell with lots of potential uses. Below are some common examples! . | If you attempt to slow down a creature wearing metal armor, Roll To-Hit target’s Vitality; on success, the creature is Slowed until the end of their next turn. | If you attempt to wield a metallic weapon at range with this spell, you may only use Basic Attacks with it, substituting your Willpower for Combat. | You may draw an unattended metallic item to or from an empty hand with this spell, immediately equipping it. | You may pull yourself towards a heavy metallic creature or object in a direct line, at a rate of 6 squares per turn. You take 2 damage for each square of Difficult Terrain you pass, ignoring Defense. | If you attempt to take a metallic object from another creature’s hands, make a Disarm attempt, using Arcana in place of your Combat. On success, the item is yanked from the creature’s hands, and you may move it up to 3 squares away from the target. If you fail, your magnetic hold on the object ends. | . Mipha’s Grace . 9 Tokens Cost: Up to (Willpower x 4) Magic (Bind) Learn Requirement: One other Spell that restores Health Range: Self, or Melee Effect: The next time the target reaches 0 HP, Burn the Magic Bound to this spell. The target is set to Prone, instantly revived, healed (bound Magic) Health, and granted bonus Temporary Health equal to (bound Magic / 4). This spell cannot be cast on someone already at 0 Health. Moa’s Invisibility . 9 Tokens Cost: 12 Magic Range: Self Effect: You become Invisible until the end of the encounter.

Pacci’s Flip . 3 Tokens Cost: 4 Magic Range: 1 Target in 8 squares, or 1 unattended object within 8 squares Effect: If the target is an object, it is flipped upside-down perfectly. This does not guarantee that its new configuration is stable; it may tip over shortly thereafter, to disastrous effects. If the target is a creature, Roll To-Hit target’s Concentration; on a success, the target is Prone and Off-Balance. You cannot use this spell on anything that is rooted, glued, nailed down, mortared, or otherwise firmly secured. Plasmarine’s Orb . 3 Tokens Cost: 3 Magic Range: Projectile 8 Damage: Weapon + Willpower, Shock . Rauru’s Shield . 3 Tokens Cost: Up to (Willpower) Magic (Bind) Range: Self, or 1 Target within 8 squares Effect: Grant the target additional Defense equal to (the Magic bound in this spell / 2). Ravio’s Hookshot . 6 Tokens Cost: 8 Magic Range: Projectile 8 Effect: If the target is lighter than you, you pull it towards you. If it is an unattended object, you may place it in your hand or inventory; if it is a creature, it lands in the square adjacent to you. If the target is heavier than you, you are pulled towards it, and placed in the nearest empty square adjacent to it. Reapling’s Sweep . 6 Tokens Cost: 10 Magic Range: Sweep 3 Damage: Weapon + (2 x Willpower), Dark . Redead’s Shriek . 6 Tokens Cost: 10 Magic Range: Cone 2 Damage: Weapon + Willpower, Dark Effect: Roll To-Hit target’s Concentration; on success, target is Frozen.

Saria’s Lifewater . 6 Tokens Learn Requirement: One other Spell that restores Health Cost: 5 Magic (Burn) Range: Self, or 1 Target within 8 squares Effect: The target regains HP equal to your Willpower. Shabom’s Encasements . 9 Tokens Learn Requirement: One other Spell that deals Water-type damage Cost: 12 Magic Range: 1 Target within 12 squares Damage: Weapon + (2 x Willpower), Water Effect: Roll To-Hit target’s Vitality; on success, target is now Soaked, and is trapped in a rainbow-colored bubble. While in the bubble, the target is considered underwater, and must use either their Swimming capability, or may walk as if Slowed. (The bubble is heavy, and rolls along the ground.) You may wriggle yourself free during your turn by spending 8 Stamina, consuming your whole turn. Striking the foe with a Shock or Piercing attack ends the bubble. Bosses and Mini-Bosses are immune to being trapped in the bubble, but will still be Soaked on success. Sol’s Gleam . 3 Tokens Cost: (Willpower) Magic (Bind) Range: An object or creature that you can touch, no bigger than 10 feet on a side Effect: The object or creature now exudes a Dim Light, in a color of your choice, in a Burst equal to (half of the Magic you spent on this spell). If the target is a creature, it may instead focus the light from its eyes in a Cone equal to (the Magic you spent on this spell). If you target a hostile creature or an object held by a hostile creature, you must roll To-Hit the target’s Concentration to successfully cast Sol’s Gleam on the target. Despite its name, light from Sol’s Gleam is a poor replacement for true sunlight, and does not succor Deku Scrubs. Stone Spikes . 3 Tokens Cost: 2 Magic Learn Requirement: Goron Range: Self Minor Action Effect: You sprout spikes of stone from your body until the start of your next turn. Once per turn, whenever you move adjacent to a foe or a foe moves into any square adjacent to you, the foe takes 1 damage. Swarms can be damaged multiple times per turn. Special: If you are in Goron Goroll, while this spell is active, you ignore all Difficult Terrain, and you can move through (but not end your turn in) an enemy’s space. Tantari Jump . 3 Tokens Cost: (Willpower) Magic (Bind) Range: Self, or 1 Target within 8 squares Effect: Add (half of the Magic you spent on this spell) to the target’s Athletics Trait, for the purposes of calculating their Horizontal and Vertical jumping capability. Terrakinesis . 3 Tokens Cost: 1 Magic per square (Bind) Range: Up to (Willpower / 2) sand or loose earth squares within 8 squares Effect: The earth solidifies into a 2-square tall, 1-square wide block of solid earth. Anything in the square is raised up on top of the block. This block can be climbed and stood on. Wherever it was formed, the block will stay put, and cannot be moved. During their turn as a Free Action, the caster may dismiss the block(s), returning the bound Magic. A block is destroyed by any attack that damages it, Spending the Magic. You may have up to (Willpower) total Magic Bound in this spell. Titan’s Strength . 3 Tokens Cost: (Willpower) Magic (Bind) Range: Self, or 1 Target within 8 squares Effect: Add (half of the Magic you Bound in this spell) to the target’s Athletics Trait, for the purposes of calculating their one-handed and two-handed Lifting capability. Twili Transit . 6 Tokens Cost: 4 Magic Learn Requirement: Twili Use Requirement: Must be standing in a deep shadow in the Light World Range: Self Effect: You merge with the shadow, becoming Invisible and intangible. While merged with the shadow, you can see, hear, and speak, but you cannot interact with objects, or take any Actions (Standard, Move, Minor, or Reaction), except to end this spell. You cannot be harmed by any physical attack, though magical attacks will harm you and cause you to be revealed, ending the spell. You cannot move, but if your shadow’s source moves, then you are carried along with it. If your shadowy spot is exposed to Bright Light or otherwise ceases to be, you are immediately revealed and the spell ends. You may end the spell as a Minor Action. This spell ends when you take a Short or Extended Rest. Special: While in the Dark World, this spell’s effects are reversed: you may hide in areas of bright light, and are revealed when shadowed. Urbosa’s Fury . 6 Tokens Cost: 10 Magic Range: Burst 1 Damage: Weapon + Willpower, Shock Effect: Roll To-Hit target’s Concentration; on success, target is Off-Balance. Vanish . 3 Tokens Cost: 8 Magic Range: Burst 1 or Blast 3 Effect: Roll To-Hit target’s Concentration; on success, target is Blinded until the end of their next turn. When you cast this Spell, you may choose to begin Sneaking as part of it, automatically succeeding against all foes caught in the attack (whether or not they are Blinded by it). Movement or actions on subsequent turns may elicit Sneaking checks as normal. Wizzrobe’s Wave . 3 Tokens Cost: 3 Magic Range: Projectile 8 Damage: Weapon + Willpower Effect: The damage from this Spell is always typeless, regardless of the weapon used. Wrath’s Whip . 3 Tokens Cost: 4 Magic Range: Melee or Projectile 3 Damage: Weapon + Willpower, Dark Effect: Roll To-Hit target’s Concentration; on success, target is Off-Balance. Yarna’s Vortex . 6 Tokens Cost: 5 Magic (Bind) Range: Blast 3 Effect: The affected area becomes Quicksand. Zaganaga’s Torrent . 6 Tokens Cost: 6 Magic Range: Projectile 4 Damage: Weapon + Willpower, Earth Effect: The target is pushed away from you in a straight line, until there are 4 squares between you and them. Roll To-Hit target’s Vitality; on success, target is Sand-Covered. Zant’s Shadowbolts . 6 Tokens Learn Requirement: One other Spell that deals Dark-type damage Cost: 12 Magic Effect: Make three separate Magic Salvo attacks, even if you are not wielding an Arcane weapon.

    "content": ". | Boosted Trait | Blinded | Burning | Cursed | Dazzled | Distracted | Electrified | Frozen | Halted | Hard to Hit | Hard to Hit, Extremely | Hasty | Helplessness | Invisibility | Knack | Mighty | Off-Balance | Oil-Soaked | On Fire | Prone | Resistant | Rusted | Sand-Covered | Sick | Slowed | Soaked | Tough | . Boosted Trait . Boosts always come with a rank. The Trait(s) in question is/are increased by 1 for each Rank of the effect. (You cannot use a boosted Trait to qualify for Feats, Spells, or Techniques, or to determine what Rank of items you can craft.) . Blinded . While Blinded, you can’t see at all. You fail all sight-based Perception checks, and all foes are Extremely Hard to Hit (see below). Being Blinded ends at the end of your next turn, unless otherwise specified. Mini-Bosses and Bosses are merely Dazzled. Burning . While a weapon is Burning, all attacks made with it are Critical Hits, even if they automatically hit. Further, all attacks do Fire-type damage, regardless of their usual damage type. The weapon also casts Dim Light as a lit torch of its Rank would. The weapon loses 1 Durability at the start of your turn, and 1 Durability from every foe it hits. (If the attack hits multiple targets, you only hit as many targets as you have Durability remaining.) A Burning weapon can be extinguished as a Minor Action, or by storing it in your pack. Burning weapons are also extinguished when you are Soaked, hit with a Water-type attack, or by entering water. Only Wooden weapons can begin Burning. (Fire-enchanted Wooden weapons don’t light themselves on fire.) . Cursed . While you are Cursed, you cannot use any Basic Attacks, Techniques, or Spells. You can still move, use tools and items (but not to directly attack), speak, perform Maneuvers and Basic Reactions, and otherwise take action. Mini-Bosses and Bosses instead do (Monster’s Rank + 1) less damage with their attacks, but suffer no limits on actions they can take. Curses last until the end of your next turn, unless stated. Dazzled . While Dazzled, you cannot see clearly. You suffer a -2 penalty to any sight-based Perception checks, and all foes are Hard to Hit (see below). Being Dazzled ends at the end of your next turn, unless otherwise specified. Distracted . When Distracted, all foes are Hard to Hit (see below), except for the source of your Distraction. If you are Distracted by multiple things, then none of your Distracting foes are Hard to Hit. If the source of your Distraction would otherwise be Hard to Hit, they no longer are; if they would be Extremely Hard to Hit, they are instead merely Hard to Hit. Electrified . When Electrified, any metallic or natural weapons that come in contact with you will conduct electricity into their user. Anyone who attacks you with a metallic or natural melee weapon suffers Shock damage equal to half the resultant damage they inflict upon you. This damage is not modified by their Defense, though it is modified by Vulnerability or Resistance to Shock. Frozen . While Frozen, you cannot take action, and are Halted. The next (non-Fire) attack to connect with you is automatically a Critical Hit, and releases you from being Frozen. You may wriggle yourself free during your turn by spending 8 Stamina, consuming your whole turn. A Frozen character can also be freed by taking any Fire-type damage or being set On Fire (cancelling both statuses). Mini-Bosses and Bosses are merely Slowed instead of being Frozen. Halted . While Halted, your Evasion is set to 0. You cannot move, or perform any Basic Attacks, Maneuvers, Techniques, or other actions that would cause you to move. Hard to Hit . While a foe is Hard to Hit, you suffer a -2 to all Rolls To-Hit and Accuracy checks against them, and your Spells and Techniques no longer automatically hit the foe (instead requiring a To-Hit check to land, including the penalty). Hard to Hit, Extremely . As Hard to Hit, but the penalty is now -5, instead of -2. This supersedes a foe being Hard to Hit. If you are Hard to Hit for multiple reasons, you may be Extremely Hard to Hit, at GM discretion. Hasty . Hasty increases your Movement by 1 per rank. Helplessness . While Helpless, a creature cannot take any Standard, Movement, or Minor actions, cannot use Reactions, and they fall Prone. A Helpless creature’s Guard Stats are all set to 0. Helpless creatures are not harmed by any attack that does not target them and them alone, but if struck by an attack specifically targeted at them, they will die. Helplessness is cured by restoring any Health, though they will still have to stand up from being Prone on their own. Invisibility . While Invisible, enemies have difficulty targeting you, and effects based on sight do not trigger for you. However, you still cast a shadow, allowing perceptive foes to know your location. If a foe attacks you while they cannot see you (due to your Invisibility), treat them as if your foe was Blinded while trying to hit you. Typically, Invisibility ends once you are struck or you make an attack (at the attack’s end). Knack . Knacks are tied to specific Traits, or uses of Traits. When you do something you have a Knack for, you may choose to either: . | Roll twice, and use the better result; or, | You may do it again, on another target within range, as part of the same action. | . Mighty . Increase your Combat &amp; Willpower by 1 for each Rank of Mighty you have. Off-Balance . While Off-Balance, you cannot use Reactions, and you cannot use Evasion in place of Concentration or Vitality. You can still use Basic Attacks, Techniques, Spells, swap gear, move, and do other things. Unless the inflicting attack or effect says otherwise, Off-Balance ends at the beginning of your next turn. (You may use a Reaction against the attack that set you Off-Balance.) . Oil-Soaked . While Oil-Soaked, you are extremely slippery, and extremely flammable. Being struck with any Fire damage will cause you to become On Fire (ending the status). You are immune to being Grappled or Soaked. If you were previously Sand\u0002Covered, the sand is saturated (cancelling both the Oil-Soaked and Sand-Covered statuses). Oil-Soaked ends when you use Soap, or take an Extended Rest. On Fire . While you are On Fire, any wooden weapons that come into contact with you (including any you are holding, but not those stored in your pack) instantly begin Burning. While you are On Fire, you suffer 2 Fire damage per turn, taken at the start of your turn. This damage is not modified by your Defense, Vulnerability, or Resistance. You may stop being On Fire by entering water, taking Water-type damage, being Soaked (canceling both statuses), or by spending your full Movement action dropping to the ground and rolling in place (which makes you go Prone at the end of it). Prone . While Prone, you are flat on the ground. You cannot use Evasion against, and cannot be Hard to Hit with, Melee, Line, and “X targets within Y squares” attacks. However, you become Hard to Hit with all other attacks. It takes half of your Movement to stand up. While Prone, you cannot move around or make attacks, but you can still perform other actions. When a Mount is knocked prone, their rider is dismounted and knocked prone. If you are Slowed, you use all your Movement to stand up; if you are Halted, you cannot stand up from Prone. Resistant . Resistance always specifies the type of damage you are resistant to, such as “Shock” or “Piercing”. For each Rank of Resistant you have for that damage type, reduce the damage by 2 (before Defense and Reactions; minimum 1). If you are also Vulnerable to that damage type, you instead reduce the incoming damage by 1 per Rank. If an attack triggers multiple Resistances, apply only the highest Resistance. Rusted . While a weapon is Rusted, its Attack Power is reduced by 3, and all foes are Hard to Hit with that weapon. Only Metal weapons can become Rusted. Rust persists until the rust is removed by applying Oil. Sand-Covered . While Sand-Covered, all of your Guard Stats are reduced by 2. Further, you suffer a -2 to all Trait checks. If you were previously Oil-Soaked, the oil is absorbed (cancelling both the Oil-Soaked and Sand-Covered statuses). Being Sand\u0002Covered also ends when you take a short or extended rest, when you are struck with a Water-element attack, when you are Soaked, or when you enter water. Sick . While Sick, every further action causes you pain. Whenever you perform a Standard Action, you suffer 2 damage afterwards. This damage can’t be reduced by Defense. While Sick, any Natural Weapons you wield have their Attack reduced by 3, and all foes are Hard to Hit with those Natural Weapons. Unless otherwise noted, Sickness persists until you restore any amount of Health (via magic, rest, or consuming a Dish or Elixir). Slowed . While Slowed, you find movement more difficult (but not impossible). Treat all terrain as Difficult Terrain – whether or not it would normally be, and whether or not you could normally walk through Difficult Terrain of that type without issue. Soaked . While Soaked, any Shock attacks that strike you turn into a Burst 1 that includes you. If this burst strikes other Soaked targets, they too inflict a Burst around themselves, and so on. (Any given creature will only take damage once from such an electric chain reaction, regardless.) Further, while Soaked, any Ice attacks that hit you will automatically inflict Frozen on you. If you were previously On Fire or your weapons were Burning, you and they are now extinguished (canceling both On Fire and Soaked). Soaked ends when you use a Towel, are struck with a Fire attack, are Frozen by an Ice attack, or take a Short or Extended Rest to dry off. Tough . Increase your Defense by 1 for each Rank of Tough you have. ",

Subrosia is a world very different from our own, lit by volcanoes and magma floes, covered in desolate scrubland. Since the fall of Calamity Ganon, Subrosians have contacted the surface world, and are now reaching out and beginning to travel. Most surface-dwellers see them just as adorable tourists, and pay them little heed. Subrosians have never shown their bare selves to anyone not of their race, preferring to hide their forms under large, concealing cloaks and hoods. Their faces appear as a pitch-black void – leading some to suspect they are spirits of darkness or the earth, rather than flesh and blood creatures. Subrosians are short – no taller than a child Hylian. They do not seem to have ever been children, at least as far as any outside observers have seen of their communities. Their large eyes glow with a pale light, and hold no pupils or irises. ",

Talking Animals may be of any number of species: alligators, bears, kangaroos, lions, rabbits, and on and on. Despite the varied menagerie they form, Talking Animals share some similarities: a love for listening to music, a calm and peaceful demeanor when their needs are satisfied, and eyes that display the intelligence and emotions that separate Talking Animals from their lesser counterparts. Most Talking Animals are bipedal, even if the ‘normal’ animal they are akin to would be quadrupedal. No matter the number of legs, however, they can wield weapons and wear armor just as well as any Hylian, though it may occasionally chafe against their fur. ",

    "content": "Talking Animal Heroes are considered naive by some, with simple goals and simple plans to achieve them. Although they are civilized enough to live and work in towns built by other races, their outlook on life will always be grounded in the basic natural instincts that all animals share. Some Talking Animals may lean into those instincts, while others strive to rise above them. Other races may have varying outlooks on Talking Animals, based on the Animal’s species – generally, depending on whether or not that species is seen as ‘cute’ or ‘dangerous’. A rabbit Talking Animal might be talked down to, seen as cute and childish (even if they’re a fearsome warrior); a bear might be seen as a deadly ruffian (even if they’re a nice and gentle person). Talking Animals sometimes struggle with having to make a ‘second first impression’ based on who, rather than what, they are. If given the chance (such as communicating by mail) they may choose to present themselves as Hylian, to avoid this issue. A few Talking Animals will even obscure their face and body, such as with heavy, concealing armor, to hide their nature while talking face-to-face with strangers. Talking Animal Heroes are difficult to pin down as a whole, and individuals of different species are likely to take different paths to heroism. As a very general rule, however, Talking Animals make for excellent warriors, particularly when resources are scarce: naturally-sharp claws and hides tough as armor are primary examples of this, but the ability to fly or swim quickly also enables them to act as skirmishers, scouting ahead and harrying foes. However, as with all broad rules of thumb, there are exceptions aplenty. Characteristics: Aware, Civilized, Dual-Natured, Instinctual, Natural, Peaceful . Talking Animal Names are varied as their species, but fall into a few patterns: . | Ordinary names | Animal puns &amp; onomatopoeia | Simple pet-like names | . The origins of a Talking Animal name might be from any real-world language, giving them a wide variety of possible names. Female Names: Christine, Edelweiss, Louise, Piyoko .

    "title": "The Trick",
    "content": "Finally, in order to make a proper Zelda-style foe, you must consider: what’s the “trick” to beating this enemy? Nearly every enemy should have some kind of trick, strategy, or weakness that Heroes can learn and use to help beat them. This trick might take one of any number of forms, such as: . | A Vulnerability to a type of damage (such as “Fire” or “Sharp” damage). | A Weak Point, which when exposed and struck, allows you to ignore the foe’s Defense or hinder their assault. | A defect in their strategy that, when noticed, the enemy cannot easily compensate for. | A way to remove some otherwise-innate power or capability that the enemy depends upon. | . For Normal monsters, Heroes shouldn’t be required to discover and utilize the “trick” in order to beat the bad guy. While it would certainly make life easier to do so, Heroes should be able to brute-force their way through almost as well. For Heavies and Minibosses, the trick should be very useful, but still not strictly required. Heroes should be encouraged to seek it out, but if they’re willing to expend lots of time and resources, they should still be able to defeat their enemy without it. Afterwards, they should take the lesson to heart, and want to discover this foe’s Achilles heel. For Bosses, the trick might be (but is not necessarily always) strictly required. In most cases where a Boss’s trick is strictly required, the Boss is totally invulnerable unless its Weak Point is exposed. Heroes should be able to uncover an enemy’s trick through observation and clever reasoning, but they can also always fall back on the Learn Lore Maneuver. If Heroes are attacking a foe who is invulnerable, or whom it isn’t advisable to attack without discovering their trick first, the GM should be sure to tell the players! Inform them that their attacks “seem to have no effect” or that “there must be a better way to do this”. It’s no fun for the players if they waste their turns and resources when there’s no chance of success. And one final piece of advice: a GM shouldn’t be afraid to let their Heroes use unconventional methods to expose Weak Points, exploit Vulnerabilities, or take advantage of a foe’s foibles – especially if it’s the kind of thing they can only do once. The fights in every Zelda game strive to be unique, interesting, and entertaining; so too should the fights in Reclaim the Wild. ",

Crafting Miscellaneous Tools does not require access to a Forge, but crafting Mundane Tools does.

    "doc": "Tools",
    "title": "Miscellaneous Tools",
    "content": "Miscellaneous Tools are typically very small, one-use objects. Miscellaneous Tools can be stacked within a single slot of your Tools pouch’s inventory, meaning you can, for instance, carry a dozen pieces of Flint in a single space. Miscellaneous Tools have a Market Price of 6 Rupees, sell for 12 from shops, and will be bought from you for 3 Rupees each, per unit. They can also be crafted from Materials. You create the number of one type of Miscellaneous Tool in the chart below, based on the Rank of the Material you used, or (your base Smithing / 2, rounded down), whichever is lower. | Mat Rank | Tools Made | . | 0 | 1 | . | 1 | 2 | . | 2 | 5 | . | 3 | 12 | . | 4 | 35 | . | 5 | 100 | . Balloon . (Monster Parts) Balloons can be filled with air, allowing them to float into the sky, or keep things from sinking into the water. A single Balloon is about the size of a Hylian’s head, and can carry 1 pound of weight (about 450 grams). Inflating a Balloon requires you to have your mouth and at least one hand free. Multiple Balloons can be tied to larger objects. Things lifted by Balloons will rise at a rate of 3 squares/minute through the air, or 6 squares/minute through water. Balloons can be burned, cut, or pierced, popping the Balloon and dropping their cargo. Balloons pop after one hour. Candle . (Monster Parts) Candles can be lit to provide a little bit of light. A single candle provides a Burst 1 of Dim Light – enough to see by. It is only bright enough to read at Burst 0, however. A lit candle will burn until the end of your next Short or Extended Rest. A Candle does not provide enough heat to stave off the cold or to cook by, but a lit candle may be used to start a proper fire. Chalk . (Monster Parts) Chalk is used to write on rough, hardy surfaces, such as stone, metal, or tree bark. A single piece of Chalk allows a Hero to write a short message, draw a picture, or make a drawing that occupies a single square. Alternatively, a single piece of Chalk can be used to draw a single line or arrow up to 10 squares in length. Chalk inscriptions left on a surface are washed away by rain or any Water-element attack, and Chalk cannot be used on submerged or Soaked surfaces. If you are using the Rebuild the Wild supplement, you may also use Stone to create Chalk. Flint . (Gems) Flint can be struck against any hard surface to generate a brief shower of glowing sparks, starting a fire on any flammable object directly beneath the Flint. This destroys the Flint. If you are using the Rebuild the Wild supplement, you may also use Stone to create Flint. Flint does not function in wet or raining conditions. Firewood . (Wood) Firewood is typically made of poor-quality wood, or the spare branches from a felled and properly-cut tree. When lit, firewood makes a small campfire that will burn until the end of your next Short or Extended Rest. These small campfires are perfect for resting around, providing warmth, a convenient place to cook, and firelight (Dim Light Burst 8, Fair Light Burst 2). Firewood, of course, is consumed upon use. Nail . (Metal) A nail is a small sliver of metal with a flat head, used to secure things into wood, hardened dirt, or other firm surfaces. Securing a nail into harder objects, like stone or metal, may require an Athletics roll; on a failure, the nail is destroyed without piercing the hard surface. Nails are metallic, and are affected by magnetism and electricity. Oil . (Monster Parts) Oil is flammable and slippery. One unit of oil will fill a single square of land or water with Oiled terrain. It can also be used to lubricate rusted or stuck machinery, fuel combustion-powered devices, remove Rust from a weapon, or to coat a single item until your next Extended Rest, protecting it from Rust for the duration. Oil can also be thrown at creatures to make them Oil-Soaked. Oil thrown this way has a Weapon Accuracy of 3, and on hit, causes no damage, but does Soak the target in Oil. Oil can be washed off by using Soap, or by taking an Extended Rest. Soap . (Critters, Food, or Monster Parts) Soap is a slippery substance. One unit of soap will fill a single square of land with a Slightly Slippery surface, or a single square of water with Foaming Water. It can also be used to clean or shine up dirty objects. Soap can remove Oil from surfaces and people, removing Oil on a one-for-one basis. Finally, Soap can also be used to groom creatures (including Heroes) and make them more presentable, giving them a +1 bonus to Influence until the end of their next Short or Extended Rest (or they next get dirty or sweaty). Going from Oil-Soaked or otherwise severely dirty, through decently clean, to well-groomed, takes 2 applications of Soap. ",

    "title": "Mundane Tools",
    "content": "Mundane tools can often be found for sale by merchants. Even though they don’t have any magical power or legendary origins, they can still be helpful to Heroes out in the wild. Mundane Tools have a Durability of 1, just like Miscellaneous Tools. However, this comes with a caveat: when they are used for their intended purpose, they do not take Durability damage. This means that (for example) you may use a Bedroll to rest outdoors an infinite number of times. However, using that same Bedroll in an unintended fashion – such as using it as a stretcher, a bridge, a sack, or a net – will consume the Bedroll when that unorthodox usage is concluded. In general, if a proposed use would “void the warranty” or make the salesperson blanch, it will use up the Tool’s Durability. Tools may be crafted for the cost of five Materials each, just like a Weapon. The Material type used depends upon the tool being created. Mundane Tools have prices equal to a Weapon of their same Rank. As a reminder: crafting Mundane Tools typically requires the use of a Forge. When making a Tool, all of the Materials used must be of the required Type; the Tool will be of the Rank of the lowest-Rank unit of Material used in its construction. Much as with making Armor or Weapons, you may only craft a Tool of a Rank equal to (your base Smithing trait / 2, rounded down). Hence, a Hero with Smithing 5 can craft Rank 0, 1, and 2 Tools, but not Rank 3. A Tool made with Rank 0 Materials can still accomplish its basic function, but will not provide bonuses. The greater a Tool’s Rank, the more effective it is, as listed in the Tool’s description. If a Tool does not have a Rank-based bonus listed (or as a guideline, when the GM invents their own Tools), Tools provide a (Rank / 2) bonus to relevant Trait Checks when performing their intended task. Some things that might be considered tools, like Shovels and Torches, might also be used as weapons. When used as weapons in this way, they count as Weapons of their same Rank and of an appropriate weapon type, of no particular Crafting Style. As Mundane Tools have a Durability of 1, they immediately break at the end of combat when used as a weapon. | Tool Rank | Merchant will buy from you for… | Market Value | Will sell to you for… | . | Rank 0 | 25 | 50 | 100 | . | Rank 1 | 50 | 100 | 200 | . | Rank 2 | 100 | 200 | 400 | . | Rank 3 | 200 | 400 | 800 | . | Rank 4 | 500 | 1000 | 2000 | . | Rank 5 | 1000 | 2000 | 4000 | . Bedroll . (Cloth) When you take an Extended Rest using a Bedroll, you restore more of your Health, Stamina, and Magic (see Rest &amp; Relaxation), and gain Temporary Health equal to (Rank x 2). You must be in a dry location, in an area you can survive without aid or armor. Book, Blank . (Wood) A blank book that can be used to record thoughts, make sketches, take notes, or create Written Books. Book, Written . (Wood) A book full of information, drawings, or writings. Typically sold at bookstores or found in libraries, with information about a single subject (such as a specific village, dungeon, historical event, or long-lost artefact). When used in conjunction with knowledge checks about the book’s subject, they give the user a (Rank / 2) bonus to the knowledge roll. Unlike other Tools, Written Books can only be crafted by simply using an Ink and Quill on an Empty Book; further, their Rank is limited both by the Rank of the Ink and Quill and of the Empty Book used to make them, and also by the user’s skill in the appropriate Trait (substituting for the Smithing skill). Books you write cannot be used to grant yourself a bonus to the skill in question, but can be used by other Heroes. Bottle . (Gems) A Bottle can contain a single large serving of a liquid substance (about 1 Liter, or 4 cups’ worth), or a single Ingredient (including Critters and Small Fairies). Bottles come with tight lids. A Bottle’s contents are kept fresh and uncontaminated for as long as they are secured in the Bottle. (A creature in a Bottle does not need to worry about suffocation.) Contents in a Bottle cannot be smelled or tasted unless the Bottle is uncorked. Bottles break when thrown, spilling their contents over whatever they hit, for good or ill. Bottles can withstand most attacks from within; however, if a creature is trapped inside a Bottle, they may be able to break through the glass, or cleverly uncork the bottle from the inside. Bottles have a Defense of (Rank x 3) against attacks from inside and out; if an attack against them does not exceed their Defense, then the Bottle is not broken and its contents are not freed. Uncorking a bottle from the inside is a Mechanics or Athletics check against a DC of (Rank x 3). Caltrops, Bag of . (Metal) Caltrops are small metallic spikes, intended to trip up pursuers or disable enemy mounts. Using a Bag of Caltrops is a Standard Action. When you use Caltrops, you cover a Cone 3 or Burst 1 with dozens of these tiny, sturdy spikes. Any creature starting their turn in, or entering, a square of caltrops takes damage equal to (1 + (Rank / 2)) damage per square passed through, unmitigated by Defense. Caltrops are Difficult Terrain. A creature passing through a square does not consume the space’s caltrops, leaving them to be stumbled upon by the next combatant. Caltrops can be removed from a single square as a Standard Action, and can be recovered after combat for use again later. Cooking Vessel, Portable . (Metal) The Portable Cooking Vessel allows its user to cook full-fledged Food Dishes and Elixirs, containing up to (2+(Rank/2)) ingredients. It still requires both a heat source (such as a fire, lantern, or a fire-enchanted weapon) as well as a dry environment, in order to function properly. Flint-fire Kit . (Gems) A Flint-fire kit allows the user to create sparks, which can in turn ignite other objects, such as torches, campfires, lanterns, and bomb or cannon fuses. Flint-fire Kits operate in Rainy weather, up to a Rank of (Rank); however, they do not function underwater. Grappling Hook . (Metal) A Grappling Hook can help attach one thing to another securely. When used with a rope, the rope can wrap around and cling to outcroppings on walls. When attached to other objects, it can be used to help secure or carry things that would otherwise be awkward to handle. Grappling Hooks are metallic, subject to magnetic and electrical forces. Ink and Quill . (Monster Parts) An Ink and Quill will let you write on paper (but not other surfaces) with clear and legible writing. An Ink &amp; Quill set is required to write in a Book. Korok Leaf . (Cloth) This large fan-like leaf can be waved to generate large gusts of wind, and requires two hands to wield. When waved, it casts the Korok Leaf’s Wind spell, substituting Stamina for Magic. You cannot spend Stamina on the spell greater than (Rank x 2). Lantern . (Metal) When lit, a Lantern provides light, heat, and a source of fire. Lanterns can stay lit even in wet or rainy conditions (but not when fully submerged underwater). It can either provide Fair Lght in a Burst (2+(Rank/2)), or Bright Light in a Cone (5+Rank). Lanterns are automatically extinguished at the end of any Short or Extended Rest. Lanterns cast their light while placed on the ground, held in the hand, or placed on the hip, but not when stored in the Pack. Musical Instrument . (Various) A Musical Instrument allows the user to play music, including Magical Songs that they may know. It can also be used to make noise, entertain, or distract. The type of material needed to make a Musical Instrument depends on what is being made: Drums might require Monster Parts, a Violin might require Wood, or a Saxophone might require Metal. Net . (Cloth) Nets cover a 3x3 square, and can be cast as a Blast 3. Nets have a Weapon Accuracy of (2 + (Rank / 2)), but they will automatically capture any targeted creature unless they are Hard to Hit. While under a Net, foes are Halted until they can cut their way free by attacking the Net. Nets will Burn if exposed to fire or extreme heat. Nets have a Health of ((Rank+1) x 6) and a Defense of (Rank); when the Net is destroyed, its contents (if any) are freed. Rope . (Cloth) Rope comes in 6-square lengths. When used to climb cliffs and walls, it provides +2 to the Athletics roll to do so. A Rope will be set Burning if exposed to fire or extreme heat. Rope is instantly cut in two by any Piercing or Sharp attack of sufficient strength, and will suffer only (Rank) full rounds of Burning before being consumed utterly. Burning or cutting a rope will consume its Durability. Ropes have a Defense of (Rank x 2) against attacks; if any attack against them does not exceed their Defense, then the Rope is not broken. Sack . (Cloth) Sacks are a handy way to carry a lot of loose or unmanageable material. Sacks are not waterproof, and can be cut open by any piercing or sharp attack. Sacks cannot be stored in your Pack while they contain other objects. Sacks will be set Burning if exposed to fire or extreme heat. Sacks have a Health of ((Rank + 1) x 5) and a Defense of (Rank); the Sack is destroyed (and its contents are freed) when the Sack runs out of Health. Shovel . (Metal) Shovels (and other digging tools) are useful for digging through snow, dirt, or even solid rock. When using a shovel, a Hero can dig through loose sand or snow at a rate of (Rank + 1) squares per hour, dirt and soil at a rate of ((Rank + 1) / 2) squares per hour, or through stone at a rate of ((Rank + 1) / 4) squares per hour. Telescope . (Gems) Telescopes allow you to see details from far away, but narrow your field of view significantly. When using a Telescope, you may see objects up to ((Rank+1) x 2) miles away, if you have clear line of sight on them. However, you cannot see anything that is not directly before you. Telescopes are sensitive to extreme light – staring at a Bright Light source may cause the user Light-element damage and/or Blind them for a time. Focusing light to cause heat, or to alter a beam of light, will consume the Telescope’s Durability. Tent . (Cloth) Tents provide shelter from the elements. While in a tent, you are shielded from rain and wind. When properly set up, Tents provide (Rank) resistance from all weather to all creatures within. A Tent has enough room for four heroes to rest comfortably (if cozily). Toolkit (Profession) . (Varies) Every Toolkit is keyed to a particular profession or skill, such as “lock-picking”, “climbing”, “forging documents”, or the like. Some tasks in a profession may require a Toolkit to even be attempted at all. When used for their chosen profession or task, Toolkits provide a bonus of (Rank / 2) to that roll for one hero. A Toolkit’s profession is decided when it is created, and is permanent. Torch . (Wood) When lit, Torches provide a source of light, heat, and fire. Torches need an external source of fire or sparks to be lit, and will not stay lit in rainy or wet conditions. They cast Fair Light in a Burst (4+(Rank/2)). Torches, despite being wooden, will never take Durability damage from Burning, and will thus never be consumed by fire; they still take Durability damage when striking foes or otherwise used as a weapon. Torches are automatically extinguished at the end of any Short or Extended Rest, when entering wet or rainy conditions, or when placed on the hip or in one’s pack. Towel/Blanket . (Cloth) Towels are large pieces of thick, absorbent cloth, useful for managing moisture. A Towel can be used on a creature or object to remove the Soaked status effect from it, as a Standard Action. A Towel can absorb a significant amount of liquid (enough to fill a Bottle), and can be used to transfer or carry liquids for a short period of time. A Towel can also be wrapped around an object to prevent it from getting wet while passing through rain or a river, if only temporarily. Towels can be used in these ways (Rank + 1) times, before needing an Extended Rest to dry. In addition, Towels can also be used as blankets, keeping a Hero warm in the cold. While used as a blanket, the Hero is Slowed and Cursed, but resists Coldsnap conditions by (Rank) steps. A Towel can only keep one Hero warm at a time. ",

    "content": "Harvesting Tools are a subcategory of Mundane Tools. Each Harvesting Tool is made with a particular type of Material, listed after its description, just like other Mundane Tools. Harvesting Tools are keyed to a particular kind of material: Ancient, Critters, Food, Gem, Metal, or Wood. A Harvesting Tool allows the wielder to harvest its designated kind of Material without consuming the Durability of a weapon (or of the Tool itself). Harvesting Tools provide a bonus to the harvesting rolls for their particular kind of Material equal to their Rank. They do not provide a bonus to finding the Material in question (that would require a Profession Toolkit). Ancient, Cloth, Gems, Metal, and Wood materials require the use of either a Tool or a Weapon to harvest. Critters, Food Ingredients, and Monster Parts can be plucked with your bare hands - though using the Tools below will give you higher yields. Ancientool . (Ancient) An Ancientool is a multi-purpose diagnostic and disassembly device, featuring multiple wrenches and screwdrivers of varying sizes, as well as devices like voltmeters, desolderers, and core-testers. Aids in harvesting Ancient materials. Butterfly Net . (Cloth) Butterfly Nets allow you to catch small, quick creatures, either on the ground or in the air. Their netting is light and fragile, but more than sufficient to trap insects, lizards, or spiders. Aids in harvesting Critters. Mallet &amp; Chisel . (Wood) Using a Mallet &amp; Chisel, you can easily separate gemstones from the rock that holds them. Aids in harvesting Gemstones. Pickaxe . (Wood) Pickaxes allow you to quickly separate metal from rock, making it much easier to pry iron, steel, and rarer metals from the clutches of the earth. Aids in harvesting Metals. Saw . (Metal) Saws enable you to make clean, straight cuts through large chunks of wood. With a saw, you can accurately fell trees, cut branches from the main trunk, and create planed planks of wood. Aids in harvesting Wood. Sickle . (Metal) Sickles are used in cutting, threshing, and paring edible plants and fruits. Aids in harvesting Food Ingredients. Skein-Winder . (Wood) A Skein-Winder is a wooden contraption used to keep strands untangled as you pull them, winding them into a skein (a loose bundle) of thread. Aids in harvesting Cloth. ",

    "title": "Magical Tools",
    "content": "Magical Tools are any object that can cast a spell on the behalf of their user, have a strange and wondrous effect, or are magically-enchanted versions of Mundane Tools. To use a Magical Tool, you must have it equipped in at least one hand. (Some Magical Tools may require two hands.) In most cases, using a Magical Tool is a Standard Action. Some Magical Tools allow you to use Spells or Techniques that you otherwise haven’t learned. In these cases, when the Magical Tool is designed, select whether it uses Magic or Stamina. This does not need to match the action’s original resource. Magical Tools may have additional rules, requirements, costs, and mechanics. More than anything else, Magical Tools are intended to be special, unique, and utterly unlike anything else in Hyrule. Much like Mundane Tools, Magical Tools have only a single unit of Durability, but do not expend that Durability when used for their intended purpose (i.e., “casting the spell in question”). If used in ways that would obviously damage the item, this will consume the item’s sole point of Durability, temporarily breaking them. Similar to Weapons with Spirits in them, Magical Tools will regenerate their Durability over an Extended Rest. Magical Tools are typically not for sale. If they are, it’s from a single person, and either for a significant price, or in exchange for a favor. More often, Magical Tools are found in dungeons, hidden away in the secret places of the world, in the armories of kings, or in the hands of other adventurers or Heroes. Below are some examples of Magical Tools. Of course, GMs should feel free to invent their own! You can also visit the website to find more additions, like Magical Tools, new Rules, and even the Master Sword! . Hookshot . One-Handed Description: This mechanical cylinder has a grip on one end, and a grappling hook on the other. Curled inside its metal casing is a long metal chain. When the trigger is pulled, the hook fires straight ahead, grabbing onto whatever it hits, and attempts to retract. Effect: Casts the Ravio’s Hookshot Spell, using Stamina instead of Magic. Kingly Paraglider . Two-Handed Description: A large, lightweight wooden frame with a sturdy cloth stretched over it. The embroidered fabric catches the air with ease, but it’s difficult to hold on to it forever. Effect: Makes the user a Natural Glider. While paragliding, you Spend 2 Stamina at the beginning of each of your turns. If you cannot Spend this Stamina, you let go of the Paraglider and begin falling. Mask of the Healed Soul . One-Handed (Special) Description: This mask, looking like an average member of some Hyrulean race, came from a departed member of that clan whose soul has been healed of all mortal worries - leaving behind its physical shell, in the form of a mask. Effect: This mask can be put on, or removed, as a Standard Action. Once put on, it does not occupy any equipment slot. While worn, your body changes to that of the person the mask is based on. You lose access to all of your Racial bonuses, Vulnerabilities, Feats, Spells, or Techniques. In their place, you gain access to all Racial effects of the mask’s Race. If this includes Feats, Spells, or Techniques, those are chosen when the mask is first created. Master Cycle Key . One-Handed Description: An ancient magical key which summons a mechanical, wheeled mount. Despite its artificial nature, this mount requires food, just like any other. Effect: When used, the Key summons a Master Cycle – an Ancient motorcycle originally developed for the one true Hero. Using the Key again dispels the Master Cycle. The Master Cycle has 10 Movement, is a Natural Walker, and is unaffected by Slick Terrain. You may mount the Master Cycle as part of the summoning action. The Master Cycle has 20 Durability, and consumes 1 Durability per combat or hour of use. If damaged in combat, the Master Cycle loses 1 Durability. The Master Cycle’s Durability can be restored by feeding it any kind of Material, restoring (Rank + 1) Durability. The exception is Ancient materials, which restore ((Rank +1) x 4) Durability. You may only feed the Master Cycle a single item per Short or Extended Rest. The Master Cycle does not have a mind of its own, and cannot act without a rider. It cannot be deconstructed. If the Master Cycle is destroyed, its Durability is set to 0. If the Master Cycle’s Durability is at 0, it cannot be ridden, but may be summoned (to be fed). ",

While Heroes can obtain all Materials by exploring the wild and defeating Monsters, they may find themselves short of a needed Type of Material, or unable to find a Material of a particular Rank.

In terms of sheer value, buying and selling Materials is more efficient than Transmutation – but that depends on a Merchant being available, and that Merchant having the desired Materials at all. Transmutation requires the use of a Forge. A Hero may take 10 pieces of a single Type of Material (such as Metal, Wood, or Cloth), and turn them into a single piece of that same Type of Material, of the next Rank up. They may only create Materials of a Rank up to (base Enchanting / 2, rounded down) with this method. You cannot create or use Ancient Materials, Critters, or Food Ingredients through Transmutation. Further, a Hero may turn 5 units of a single Type and Rank of Material into a single unit of a different Material, at the same Rank. You may use this to change Metal into Cloth, for example, or an Onyx into a Ruby. Heroes may only do this on Materials of a Rank up to (base Enchanting / 2, rounded down). ",

    "content": "The Twili are descended from dark sorcerers who were magically exiled from Hyrule long ago. Their home, the Twilight Realm, has since suffered periods of war and strife: their initial hardships in colonizing their home in exile, periods of political instability due to an empty throne, the rise of the usurper Zant to power (and his subsequent defeat), and numerous other trials that would end many other societies. Now, in small numbers, those Twili with a soul for adventure can return to the Light World. They seek power, wisdom, and courage – the aspects of the Triforce that their ancestors failed to claim by force. They might also seek knowledge of their race’s origins, or just a safe and secluded place to call their own. Those rare Twili who now reside in Hyrule tend to live in dimly-lit, well-appointed homes – the bright sunlight of the Light World is annoying, perhaps even painful, to their senses. (For Twili who venture into the Dark World, its oppressive darkness might be similarly disconcerting – their Vulnerability may even change to Darkness while there!) . Twili typically have two-toned skin, with some parts of their body gray or black as the night, with other parts a lighter blue-gray or almost-white tint. Their skin is adorned with thin-lined patterns, mazes that glow with a faint blue neon color. A Twili’s eyes are normally red, yellow, or orange; their hair, too, falls in this spectrum, ranging from neon-bright to a dull hue as they age. They are usually quite thin, as well as much taller, than Hylians. ",

    "content": "Twili Heroes are often creatures of sly wit and subtle plans. They rarely commit fully to a single cause, seeing both the darkness and the light in all people and situations – giving some Twili a cynical sense of humor. Their sardonic humor is further strengthened by the state of their homeland: the Twilight Realm is always facing hardships, from a simple lack of resources, to courtly intrigue and backstabbing viziers, to deadly beasts and vengeful wizards who rise from the dark mists surrounding the twilight-lit towns. To a Twili, it’s hard all over. In Hyrule, a world filled with blinding light, they have hope. Twili are aware of their ancestors’ history with Hyrule – their grab for power, and subsequent exile – even if many of the denizens of Hyrule have forgotten. Some Twili seek to atone for these misadventures, while others might be trying to simply explore a new land, with its too-bright sun and small, curious people. Because of their ability to sink into shadows and see in darkness, Twili make for versatile rogues and sneak-thieves. Their ability to keep additional items at the ready makes them versatile warriors and alchemists, able to swap weapons, devices, or potions to meet any situation. Characteristics: Balanced, Ethereal, Magical, Mercurial, Nocturnal . Twili Names are typically based on aspects of light or darkness, often shortening a word to create a name. (They may also use such words from other real-world languages as their basis.) . Female Names: Dawn, Ecli, Eventi, Hamara, Midna, Nocturne .

The Twilight Realm rests in a permanent twilight, with motes of darkness rising from the land to meet a sunset-drenched sky. As a realm created by, and for, exiled sorcerers, magic suffuses everything in the realm, and even the shadows feel heavy with potency. The Twilight Realm has no direct sunlight, making life difficult for its denizens. To counter this deficiency, they create and use Sols, melon-sized spheres of magical power that cast a bright white glow over their surroundings. In the light of these Sols, life can grow and thrive, and evil curses are cast aside. Sols also power the magical and technological innovations of Twili society, from moving platforms to imbuing the power of light on weapons. The Twilight Realm is said to be connected to Hyrule via the Mirror of Twilight, a giant mirror locked away deep within the Gerudo Desert. Scholars argue whether other artefacts exist that might link the worlds of Light and Twilight together, pointing to examples like the Magic Mirror of Hebra Mountain, or perhaps lost shards of the Mirror of Twilight. If Twili adventurers roam the land of Hyrule, surely there must be some conduit between the two worlds. ",

Brush, Thick . Difficult Terrain. Turns into Brushfire when struck with a Fire attack, or if adjacent to something else that is On Fire (such as Brushfire terrain) at the end of a round of combat or every five minutes. Brushfire . Terrain that is currently on fire. Deals 2 Fire damage when stepping into it or starting one’s turn in it, ignoring Defense. Will light one On Fire if one spends an entire turn (start to finish) in Brushfire. While burning, casts Dim Light in a Burst 1, and creates an Updraft. Ceases burning after 5 minutes, turning into normal terrain. Electrified . Deals 2 Shock damage, and sets one Off-Balance, when stepping into it or starting one’s turn in it, ignoring Defense. Grass, Tall: Normal terrain (does not impede or hinder movement). Large swaths of tall grass are good places to hide, or scavenge for Critters. As flammable as Thick Brush. Ice, Dry . Slightly Slick surface. Ice, Slick . Severely Slick surface. Lava . Lava is a liquid, and thus can be swum in – with disastrous consequences for most Heroes. Lava deals 4 Fire damage, and sets you On Fire, when stepping into it or starting one’s turn in it, ignoring Defense. Malice . Deadly terrain suffused with evil. Deals 4 damage, and makes you Sick, when stepping into it or starting one’s turn in it, ignoring Defense. Mire . Viscous swamp-water. May be knee\u0002deep (letting you to trudge through it) or deeper (requiring swimming). Difficult Terrain. Deals 2 damage when stepping into it or starting one’s turn in it, ignoring Defense. Oiled . A Severely Slick surface. When you fall Prone, if all spaces you occupy are Oiled, then you become Oil-Soaked. If the oil is on the surface of water, you are Oil-Soaked only so long as you occupy those squares. If an Oil-Soaked square is intentionally struck with a Fire attack, exposed to excessive heat or errant sparks, or is adjacent to Brushfire at the start of the round, it becomes Brushfire. Pit, Bottomless . Bottomless Pits are weird and dangerous. If you fall into a Bottomless Pit, you disappear. You reappear at the start of your next turn, at the edge of the battlefield or the entrance of the room. You then take 4 damage, ignoring Defense. Sand, Deep . Difficult Terrain. Sand, Quick . Difficult Terrain. If a creature spends a full turn on Quicksand, they sink to their hips and become Halted and Sand\u0002Covered, and must spend a Standard Action to dig themselves out (ending the Halted status, but not the Sand-Covered status). Slick, Severely . When moving horizontally on a Severely Slick surface, you must make an Agility roll v. DC 16 to stop. If you fail, on an odd-numbered roll, you continue to move in the direction you were travelling until you bump into something (like a creature or solid object) or leave the Severely Slick surface; on an even-numbered roll, you fall Prone. When moving vertically on a Severely Slick surface (such as climbing), make the roll using Athletics. On a failed odd roll, you slide back down until you bump into something; on a failed even roll, you lose your grip and fall. Slick, Slightly . When moving horizontally on a Slightly Slick surface, you must make an Agility roll v. DC 10 to stop. If you fail, on an odd-numbered roll, you will continue to move one further square in the direction you were travelling; on an even-numbered roll, you become Off-Balance. When moving vertically on a Slightly Slick surface (such as climbing), make the roll using Athletics. On a failed odd roll, you slide back down one square; on a failed even roll, you become Off-Balance. Snow, Deep . Difficult Terrain. Water, Current . Currents in water can carry swimmers along, whether they like it or not. When you enter or start your turn in a current, you are immediately pulled along by it. Weak currents will only pull you 2 squares; a strong current will pull up to 6 squares; a torrential current, up to 10. Water . When you enter water (whether Foaming, Fresh, or Salt), you become Soaked. This Soaked status can’t be removed until you exit the water. Water, Foaming . Difficult Terrain. Dazzles anyone while they are in the foam. Water, Fresh . Freshwater, including most streams and lakes, can have negative consequences for metallic equipment. While swimming in freshwater, whenever metal weapons take Durability damage (including at the end of combat), roll (2d6+Rank) – on a roll of 10 or less, the item is Rusted. Water, Salt . Saltwater, including ocean water, has disastrous effects on metallic items. While in saltwater, whenever metal weapons take Durability damage (including at the end of combat), they automatically become Rusted. ",

Spent Stamina and Magic functions quite simply: you can spend points up to your maximum, but no further. When points are spent, they will return at the end of the encounter or scene. Bound Stamina and Magic is ‘tied up’ in whatever effect it was used for. If the effect ends, the Stamina or Magic is returned to the user immediately, and can be used howsoever they like. Some Bind effects will have conditions where the Bound Stamina or Magic are then Spent or Burned, rather than returning to the user. A creature may end any Bound effect(s) in their control as a Free Action on their turn. If a creature with Bound Stamina or Magic is knocked unconscious, all of their Bound effects immediately end, returning thatStamina or Magic to them. Burned Stamina and Magic is a slightly more permanent cost: while Spent points return when the Hero catches their breath (typically the end of a battle or scene), Burned points will return only during an Extended Rest, or from consuming Food or Elixirs. When reducing the cost of Spells or Techniques, do percentile reductions first, one at a time (don’t add percentages together). Then, apply flat cost reductions. If the final cost ends in a .5, round the total cost down. A Spell or Technique’s cost can’t be reduced below 1 Magic or Stamina. (Some Spells or Techniques may have a cost that starts at 0). ",

However, ignoring the weight of money and ammunition is increasingly standard in both video games and in tabletop RPGs. By default, Reclaim the Wild has few limits on how many Rupees, arrows, or bombs can be carried at once – but for those who want that element and extra challenge of inventory management, Master Mode provides. First, add a Wallet to the Hero’s Pack. Wallets act like any other Inventory type, except they can only carry a single type of thing: Rupees. The Wallet begins with only a single slot, and can be upgraded as any other Inventory type could be. Each slot in the Wallet can carry 100 Rupees – meaning a Hero with the maximum size of Wallet can carry up to 3,000 Rupees on their person. (It is suggested that Heroes who wish to deal with large amounts of money in this scenario seek out, or establish, a Bank or other safe place to store any money they cannot carry.) . Second, the Ammunition inventory is slightly altered: each slot in the Ammunition inventory can now only carry 20 of a given type of ammunition. If a Hero has 40 Arrows, they would take up 2 slots – and if they have 41 Arrows, they would take up 3 slots. Slots in a Hero’s overflow Inventory also follow these rules: a single slot in the overflow Inventory can carry 100 Rupees, or 20 units of an Ammunition type. ",

When a Weak Point is struck, the attack ignores all Defense, statuses, weapons, resistances, and all other factors on the foe that might lessen the damage.

    "content": "Consider the stakes. Heroes do not solely build their legend by fighting powerful foes; the best-remembered, most talked-about battles happen on both a tactical and an emotional level. When designing a Boss, think about what the stakes are for your Heroes. Don’t be afraid to use emotional bonds, innocent bystanders, or difficult choices, to make the battle memorable – and a problem that can’t be solved solely with brute force. Make the battlefield part of the fight. Boss fights are intended to be epic and memorable set pieces, and should take place on an impressive stage. Consider making the arena interactive – perhaps it has traps and hazards that the Heroes must deal with while fighting the Boss, or weather that inconveniences both friend and foe. Alternatively, perhaps the battlefield can be used against the Boss, weakening them, or preventing them from using their full power (giving the Boss a chance to be a memorable, recurring foe!) . Consider giving them a Backup Weapon. When faced with a powerful foe using a powerful weapon, Heroes are liable to try and disarm their foe with the Disarm Combat Maneuver. By giving your Boss or Miniboss a backup weapon (one less powerful than their preferred weapon), you allow this tactic to still be effective, without neutering it outright. If you make the backup weapon a Natural Weapon, you also prevent Heroes from disarming the Boss repeatedly: they may remove the foe’s more powerful preferred weapon, but still need to deal with them using their less-powerful Natural Weapon. There’s more to a Boss than statistics. Bosses and Minibosses, moreso than other foes, might have enchanted equipment, and multiple Spells and Techniques, to bring to bear. They might also have minions and traps at their disposal. Truly calculating Bosses might even spy on the Heroes, tailoring their kit and defenses to counter what they observe. Don’t forget that intelligent enemies (including Bosses and Minibosses) can use items, Maneuvers, and many other unorthodox strategies, to try and win the day. Perhaps the bandit warlord orders his men to try and disarm the Heroes, and has his lieutenant stay behind him – with a hostage he can use as a human shield or a bargaining chip, if the tides turn against him.

All weapons have an Attack Power, a Durability rating, and an Accuracy. This is determined by the Weapon’s Type, the Weapon’s Rank, and the style in which the crafter made the item. Weapon Type determines what kind of weapon it is – a sword, a spear, a boomerang, a bow, and so on. This also helps determine its stats; for instance, a Greatsword does more damage than a Sword, but is slightly less accurate. Weapons also have a Rank, from 0 to 5. The higher a weapon’s Rank is, the more damage it does, the more Durability it has, and the more valuable it is. Finally, Weapons can be made in certain Crafting Styles. This modifies the Weapon’s stats further. For instance, a Goron weapon is sturdier than most of its type, but is also less deadly. Weapons may only have, at most, a single Crafting Style. ",

    "content": "Weapons can only be created at a Forge. You may only craft Weapons of a certain rank if (your base Smithing trait) is at least twice its rank - so a hero with Smithing 5 can craft Rank 0, 1, and 2 Weapons, but not Rank 3 Weapons, no matter what materials or time they have. Weapons have a Material Type: a Weapon is either Ancient, Metallic, or Wooden, based on the type of Material that makes up the majority (at least 50%) of the weapon when it is crafted. A weapon must have one, and only one, majority Material defining its type. The remaining Material cost of the weapon may be paid for with Ancient, Metal, Monster Parts, or Wood Materials. Materials used in creating a Weapon must be equal to or greater than the Rank of the Weapon. You cannot use lower-ranked Materials in your Weapon. (For instance, when making a Rank 2 Sword, you may use Rank 2, 3, 4, or 5 Materials, but not Rank 0 or 1 Materials.) . Different weapon types have different modifiers on their Attack Power and Durability, and have different Accuracy scores. Consult the chart on the next page to see how a weapon’s type alters its Accuracy, Attack, and Durability. (For instance, while a Rank 2 Sword has an Attack Power of 9, a Rank 2 Greatsword has an Attack Power of 10.) . Finally, if you know a Crafting Style, you may apply it to the weapon during its creation (but never afterwards). This further modifies its Material cost, Attack Power, Durability, Accuracy, and may also grant it additional special properties. When all is said and done, no Weapon may have an Attack Power, Durability, or Accuracy of less than 1. Once you’ve made your weapon, you may also describe and name it, if you like! . ",

    "title": "An Example",
    "content": "Torvan, the chivalrous Zora knight, decides to craft a new Sledge. His Smithing Trait is at Rank 6, meaning he is capable of crafting up to Rank 3 Weapons. He has several units of Knuckle Alloy (a Rank 3 Metal), as well as many Monster Parts, and access to a suitable Forge. To begin with, a Rank 3 Weapon has an Attack Power of 12, and a Durability of 12. As a Sledge, however, the weapon is a little more durable, and less powerful: a typical Rank 3 Sledge has only 12 Attack Power, but a Durability of 15 – a low-damage, long-lasting two-handed weapon. All Sledges have a below-average Accuracy bonus of 2. All Weapons require 5 units of Material of their Rank, and at least half of those must be Ancient, Wood or Metal (and Torvan is using Knuckle Alloy, a Metal material). However, Torvan knows how to craft in the Gerudo style, and decides to use those teachings here. The weapon will be more powerful (with 2 more Attack Power), but will cost and extra unit of material to create – a price Torvan is willing to pay. Thus, he’ll use three units of Knuckle Alloy, and three Rank 3 Monster Parts, to make his weapon. He could have used more Knuckle Alloy instead, but not less – at least half the weapon’s cost must be paid in metal to make a Metal weapon. After some time at the Forge, Torvan creates a Rank 3 Sledge in the Gerudo style. It has an Attack Power of 14, a Durability of 15, and an Accuracy of 2. Torvan names his new weapon a “Sunfury Sledgehammer”, and describes it as an ornate golden warhammer with a long silver handle. Now, perhaps he can interest an ally in Enchanting it for him… . ",

When a Returning weapon comes back to you, you instantly re-equip it to the hand(s) it was in previously.

When a Hero takes up an improvised weapon, the GM must determine what weapon type it is most akin to, to serve as the improvised weapon’s weapon type. For instance, a soup ladle might be akin to a Club, and a pot-lid might make a handy impromptu Shield. Improvised weapons are always considered Rank 0, even if they are made from the finest of materials. This means they provide little extra damage, but they allow a Hero to use their attacks, and to Parry or Deflect blows. Generally, any improvised weapon will only have a single unit of Durability, breaking after the end of the current combat encounter. If the item was designed to suffer significant wear and tear, it may have up to 3 Durability. ",

If the roll is equal to or greater than (7 + Weather’s current Rank), the weather gets one step more intense. If the weather is instead only equal to or greater than (4 + Weather’s current Rank), then it remains at the same intensity. If it’s lower than even that, then the weather decreases in intensity. When Heroes take an Extended Rest, the GM should perform this Weather Check three times, to simulate the weather changing over a long night. Heroes, sages, or evil wizards skilled at performing Magical Songs may be able to use the Wind’s Requiem Song to bend the results of these Weather Checks – and thus, the weather itself – to their whim.

Forges are typically found in towns – you may need to barter or cajole your way into being allowed to use them, or grateful townspeople may give heroes use of their forges for free, to show their appreciation or to better prepare them to help solve their problems. To cook Food and Elixirs, you must have access to a Cooking Vessel and a source of heat. Cooking Vessels are found in towns, but also in many smaller bastions of civilization, such as roadside stables, inns, and points of interest. You can also purchase or craft a Portable Cooking Vessel, enabling you to make meals over a campfire. Inventory Pouches do not require access to a Forge to be crafted. However, crafting a whole-new Pack (for a trusty steed or sidekick) does require a Forge. Enchanting a piece of equipment also requires access to a Forge. You can deconstruct Weapons, Armor, and Tools wherever you find yourself – it’s much easier to take apart than it is to make. This can be handy if you find yourself with far too many items to take back to town, and don’t want to leave your loot behind. Crafting, deconstruction, and other similar actions, can typically only be done during a Short or Extended Rest. There is no limit to how much crafting you can do during a rest. ",

Zora communities can sometimes be wary of outsiders, but that doesn’t stop adventurous individuals from exploring the world’s lakes, rivers, and oceans. Zora are humanoid, but with many fish-like traits. Their skin is smooth and scaly, like a shark’s; their hands and feet are webbed, and small fins adorn their arms and legs; they have gills, allowing them to breathe underwater. Instead of hair, Zora feature long, fish-like tails on the backs of their heads, which work as a dorsal fin to help them move gracefully underwater. Individual Zora’s head-tails may take after different types of fish, such as sharks and manta rays. Zora skin is typically two-toned, featuring a nearly-white chest, thighs, and face, with the rest a bright, vibrant color that varies from Zora to Zora. (Some Zora clans, however, feature more muted gray-blue tones for their primary coloration.) . Zora make their homes in or near large bodies of water, such as waterfalls, lakes, and beaches. They typically build close to shore, if not above the water, in order to better access the bounty of nature both above and below the water. Their homes are often seen as breathtakingly beautiful by other races, constructed of coral or hewn into sparkling underwater grottos. ",

    "content": "Zora Heroes are often creatures of deep and abiding passion, but with an outer shell of propriety and grace. When first met, they may be focused solely on the task at-hand, or on a long-term goal, and have little time for social chatter. Once someone has proven themselves a friend to a Zora – or when something exciting or unexpected happens – they may drop this facade without fanfare, and become all giddy, shark-toothed smiles. Zora think about cultures, people, events, and consequences as a network of rivers and lakes, all intertwined. Actions flow downstream, continuing on to other, once-uninvolved people in unpredictable ways. Consequences can tumble downriver quickly, or be buried in the muck only to be unearthed ages later. Evil pollutes the stream, subtly harming everyone it touches. Whether action is taken or deferred, everything is carried by the currents of fate. Zora Heroes typically prize accuracy over damage, preferring not to waste a single blow. This serves them well underwater, where foes and prey can be more agile than land-dwellers might be used to. It also makes them well-suited to use magic spells that have additional effects for an accurate casting, allowing a Zora mage to speak with (relative) certainty when they say they’ll neutralize an opponent. Characteristics: Amphibious, Graceful, Passionate, Proper, Sensitive . Zora Names tend to be based on fish and musical terms. Female Names: Dunma, Finley, Keye, Kodah, Laruto, Mei, Oren, Rutela, Tula . Male Names: Bazz, Cleff, Gruve, Jiahto, Mikau, Muzu, Torfeau, Ralis, Rivan, Toto . ",

    "content": "Zora generally keep to crystal-clear lakes and rivers, and stay away from stagnant mires or polluted streams. This isn’t merely an issue of preference, though – long-term exposure to polluted water can have a powerfully negative effect on Zora. In some regions of Hyrule, generations of Zora who have lived in foul water, or who have been corrupted by evil, have had their appearance change and become more bestial. Their minds, too, are altered, becoming more primitive and territorial, and many are unable to read, write, or speak. The Zora call them “Zola”, though most other races might call them “River Zora”, for their propensity to shoot Zola’s Fireballs at anyone who nears their territory. Zora consider the Zola a touchy subject. They feel that their mere existence highlights a great weakness in themselves, either biological or spiritual, depending on what might have corrupted the local Zola population. (They also find the phrase “River Zora” offensive.) Most Zora only speak of the Zola with people they trust implicitly; some may see them as enemies to be wiped out, while others may pity them as lesser reflections of themselves. To prevent this fate from befalling their offspring, Zora communities will keep their eggs (each about the size of a melon) in special aquariums. These tanks are closely monitored by scholars, checked for pollutants, acidity, and evil magic. Some of these aquariums are kept under heavy guard at all times, particularly in Zora communities that face a direct threat. Stealing a Zora egg from one of these aquariums is the highest of crimes, and the most difficult of capers. ",
